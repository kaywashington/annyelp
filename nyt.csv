Le Bernardin,"“When I tell people that the city’s great sushi counters are guardians of a cultural legacy, they usually know what I’m talking about. When I make the same case about Le Bernardin, the cushioned, curtained and carpeted seafood restaurant on West 51st Street, I get blank stares. The legacy is more obvious with sushi because we watch in close-up while Shion Uino and Tadashi Yoshida carve and shape each piece of nigiri. They’re letting us watch their craft, although their knife slashes are so quick we may miss most of it. But Eric Ripert, Le Bernardin’s chef, and Eric Gestel, the executive chef, do their work out of sight. While the servers can tell you exactly what each dish is, they don’t deliver pious homilies on the chef’s process — the story-time schtick mocked by “The Menu.” I started thinking about the craft of Le Bernardin in the fall, as I was getting ready to give it a fresh review. The last time I had looked it over, in 2012, I had arrived at the same four-star rating that it had held in every New York Times review since it opened, in 1986. There was not a lot of suspense in the process. But 2012 might as well be another epoch. Since then, we’ve seen what New York is like without restaurants. For a while after it reopened, Le Bernardin was operating at 25 percent seating capacity, with seven people in the kitchen. Covid restrictions are long gone, and the restaurant again has about as many employees as it did before the pandemic. But when I made a reservation last fall, I didn’t know quite what I’d find or how it would compare with 10 years ago. Something I ate about half an hour into that first meal stopped me short. It was an appetizer: sweet, warm wedges of sea scallops with tender bright-green leeks under a mound of osetra caviar. You’d think that much caviar — it looked as if it had been put there with an ice cream scoop — would obliterate the other flavors, but it didn’t. What froze me in place was, in fact, the sauce. A beautiful pale yellow, it tasted like the layer of lemon and butter at the bottom of a pot of mussels served at the best bistro in heaven. My thoughts ran something like this: Oh, this is good. This is very good. This is, um, fantastic. Wow, they did it. They kept it alive.“They” are Mr. Ripert and Maguy Le Coze, who own Le Bernardin and have stubbornly insisted on sticking to their way of doing things. (No great restaurant stays great for that long without stubborn owners.) What was “it”? That took longer to articulate. Obviously Mr. Ripert and Ms. Le Coze had kept the business alive, but there was something else at work, something like the collective knowledge, experience, skill, memory, points of reference and judgment of Le Bernardin’s people. It was preserved through the near-death experience of the shutdown, and now I knew it had come through intact. I knew it from the caviar and leeks, the scallops and the soft lemon sauce, and how they worked together so beautifully. If you know anything about Le Bernardin, you know that it is famous for its skill with seafood. Each time I go, I think I appreciate a little more how extensive that skill is. It’s a lot more than knowing how much time an octopus needs on the flame, and how little time a squid needs, although that’s part of it. Become a regular at Le Bernardin and you may come to feel that the fish in most other restaurants is overcooked. (The prices, which start at $120 for three courses at lunch and accelerate up to $298 for an eight-course tasting menu with caviar and langoustines, may help you avoid that fate.) There is the appraising eye needed to choose raw ingredients, like the yellowfin tuna that is hammered into a thin ruby-colored sheet and draped like silk over a thin open-faced sandwich of foie gras on toasted baguette. This, of course, requires a different technique from the hand-chopping that produces tuna tartare, which the kitchen tops with sea urchin on paper-thin toasts. Any number of sushi parlors might try this, but only Le Bernardin would surround the tuna with a warm bath of beef bouillon at the last minute. The menu categorizes these dishes as Almost Raw. With a little more heat, you get the warm appetizers called Barely Touched — melting cuttlefish splashed with red-pepper and sun-dried-tomato oil, or a version of salmon tataki with seared Tasmanian sea trout in ponzu that’s been darkened and complicated by black garlic. The largest dishes, the main courses, are termed Lightly Cooked. This is where you find a kind of salute to the Spanish tapas hour — crisp green olive rings, toasted almonds and a creamy sauce of shallots and sherry, all in support of a long, golden fillet of sautéed Dover sole with a hint of pink at its core. Lightly Cooked is also where you will find yellowtail amberjack, or hiramasa, darkly crosshatched from the grill where it was seared to a temperature not wildly different from that of the Barely Touched sea trout. The three menu categories are not like the gears on a three-speed bike; there is a lot of variability within and across them. The thing to keep in mind is that the cooks know hundreds of species of sea creatures inside and out. The pastry kitchen, now led by Orlando Soto, has a similar command of ingredient and technique. But Le Bernardin never rubs your nose in all this know-how. The craft is put in the service of the restaurant’s deeper goal, which is to present New York with the Le Bernardin way of eating and drinking. Mr. Ripert and Ms. Le Coze have been refining their ideas on how things should be done since they first learned the restaurant trade decades ago in France, before immigrating to New York City. Take the sauces, probably the defining feature of French restaurant cooking. Ms. Le Coze insists that they be applied to the plates generously, so there is enough to eat with a spoon. Six full-time cooks prepare something like three dozen sauces on any given day. Mr. Ripert told me in a phone interview that sauces are the reason Le Bernardin has never gone in for arranging food on boards, stones, logs and other objects. He prefers china because china excels at holding sauce in one small area so you can spoon it up and love it. (Every once in a while, I don’t love it. I can’t figure out why there wasn’t more lemon or vinegar in a brown-butter emulsion spooned around a curved wing of skate.) The china, the sauce spoons, the tablecloths, the servers in dark jackets presenting plates in synchrony, the sommeliers (there are at least four on the floor at almost all times) wearing silver tastevins on chains around their necks — it can sound oppressive. When it’s all in motion, though, it’s the opposite of oppressive. Even people who are used to eating in restaurants that are less formal and less French figure out pretty quickly that almost everything about Le Bernardin is meant to make them feel good. The dining room itself, though, can feel a little impersonal. For all the money that’s gone into the design, the atmosphere is still short on mystery or romance. This grand, leisurely, formal style has been in retreat for decades. Lately it has become suspect on different grounds, as we’ve learned more about various ways some high-profile restaurants have abused workers and volunteers. The latest reports concern Noma, in Copenhagen, which until recently put unpaid interns in jobs that could require up to 70 hours of work a week. (Mr. Ripert said Le Bernardin pays everyone who works there, including the students sent by culinary schools, for their hours, including overtime.) At this point, expensive restaurants have gotten so much bad press that I know people who wish that whole end of the restaurant business would disappear. They’re dreaming — somebody will always pay more to eat in the restaurant that gets the best tuna. And it’s not as if the sector of the business known, vaguely, as fine dining has a monopoly on bad behavior. There must be some nasty owners at burger franchises and foul-mouthed, lecherous chefs at truck-stop diners, too. And what if all the exacting, creative, quality-obsessed restaurants did go away? We’d lose more than fancy meals for rich people. A great restaurant can be a sort of cultural preserve, a place where rare skills are passed on from one pair of hands to the next. Even formal restaurant service is built on careful study of human behavior, if it’s done right. A restaurant like Le Bernardin is run by people who know things that others haven’t learned yet. This is part of what ran through my head, too, when I tasted those scallops and their cream sauce and thought, “They kept it alive.”",2
Yoshida,"“If you show up a few minutes early for your 5:30 p.m. reservation, Tadashi Yoshida’s door on the Bowery will be locked. It is also unmarked. To the right of the entrance is a discreet panel with a buzzer just below the name, Yoshino; after you press the button, someone will appear in the door to undo the bolt and let you in. The procedure will be the same for the other nine people who have booked online for the early seating. Then, shortly before 8:30, another 10 customers will be admitted, and that will be it for the night. Each week, barring no-shows, 120 people will sit at Mr. Yoshida’s counter for an eye-opening procession of two- or three-bite appetizers followed by traditional nigiri sushi. Repeat customers are common. I have met diners who have eaten at Yoshino’s hinoki-wood counter half a dozen times or more since it opened in 2021. One was celebrating her 16th birthday. In his first year, Mr. Yoshida charged $515 for a meal, which included service and tax but not drinks. A few weeks ago, the price went up to $646. This is obviously not within the means of very many 16-year-olds, or 60-year-olds, for that matter. If you have that kind of money, I can’t tell you whether you, personally, should spend it on a single dinner at Yoshino. But I have some idea why people who have eaten there keep coming back. Some sushi restaurants are at their best early in the meal, others at the end. Their omakase sets are like plane flights — some ascend slowly and don’t hit cruising altitude until the appetizers are over; with others, the first piece of nigiri means your descent has already begun. (Masa is like that.) A meal at Mr. Yoshida’s counter is more like a helicopter: it goes straight up. Your meal might begin with a cool, silky potato soup. How many other chefs in New York can get your attention by serving vichysoisse as a first course? Surely there’s nobody else garnishing it with lumps of kegani, the Hokkaido hairy crab, under a spoonful of jellied tosazu sauce and a big, dark cluster of osetra caviar. After this might come two mini-slabs of monkfish-liver terrine. They are impossibly soft for something that has edges and corners. If the city’s foie gras ban ever takes effect, you’ll be able to get the same high, or something close to it, from this liver, one slice served with a dot of grated wasabi and the other with translucent sweet pickles. Mr. Yoshida will tell you how to eat it, as he tells everyone who comes to his restaurant: “Take a little bite, then sake. Little bite, sake. Then sake, sake, sake…” His repertoire of jokes in English is limited, but he makes the most of it. Within minutes he seems to establish an easy rapport with diners, letting them know that there’s no need to take it all so seriously. To open his restaurant on the Bowery, Mr. Yoshida closed Sushi no Yoshino, the restaurant in Nagoya, Japan, that he had brought to national and then worldwide acclaim. He is probably the first sushi chef of his stature to leave Japan in order to start fresh in New York. In a little more than a year, he has established Yoshino in the city’s highest tier of omakase restaurants. Its nearest peer is Shion 69 Leonard Street, where the chef is Shion Uino, and I think Mr. Yoshida’s range is greater and his style more expressive. Also at the tip of the sushi pyramid, but below Yoshino and 69 Leonard Street, is Nakaji. After that comes everybody else. Yoshino is a showpiece of meticulous carpentry, from the spindle-backed chairs in which two hours feel like no time at all to the sliding doors made of interlocking pieces of hinoki joined without nails or screws. Pay special attention to the space where Mr. Yoshida stands, and how skillfully it has been outfitted with grooves and hollows to hold his knives, rice steamers and other tools. It is the work station of a chef who knows exactly what he needs and what he doesn’t. For all the skill his cooked appetizers display, Mr. Yoshida can get startling effects from ingredients that he barely touches. Rosy folds of raw sea bream rest under a mango-colored piece of karasumi, mullet roe that is salted, pressed and aged into something that tastes like fish-egg ham. In late fall and into the winter, there may be shirako, sacs of cod milt in loose white coils over ponzu sauce. I am not sure how many of Yoshida’s repeat customers return for the shirako itself, but I am certain a good number return because Yoshino is the kind of place where a no-choices tasting menu may well include a bowlful of fish semen. Maybe it’s not quite your cup of tea. Almost everybody, though, loves the yaki saba sushi that forms the bridge from the appetizers to the nigiri portion of dinner. The dish begins as a strip of shiny, oily, cured mackerel over a log of rice on a plate. With that in one hand, Mr. Yoshida grips a brazier of binchotan charcoal in the other and holds it just above the mackerel’s skin, warming it slowly. Then, like mission control, he counts down from 10. By this time, phones up and down the counter have been lifted from their phone-size tatami mats. At the moment of liftoff, he touches the mackerel with the glowing coals. The skin hisses. Steam shoots out. Shutters click. The payoff for you is a piece of sushi pinched inside a papery square of nori. The heat has driven fat out of the mackerel and into the rice, which is now bound together by rich fish oils. None of the pieces of nigiri that follow will be photographed from quite as many angles, but their pleasures will be just as real. The rice will be just sticky enough to hold together for a few seconds on its way to your mouth. It will be just tart enough that you can sense the presence of vinegar without quite tasting it. Almost all the fish have been pickled or salted or aged in some other way before they end up on your plate. This is something to keep in mind when you start to wonder, as you probably will, why the kohada tastes so lemony and bright; why the Spanish mackerel seems as if it were smoked even though it isn’t; and where the tuna, three pieces of increasing richness served one after another, gets its wiry minerality. And then the fish are finished. Mr. Yoshida hands you a yellow square of tamago that is doing a deadpan impersonation of crème brûlée, down to the glassy lid of burned sugar on top. This is almost a dessert and the next course is totally a dessert. A sliver of Basque cheesecake, it is, in texture at least, less cake than cheese, with the creamy, runny softness of a triple crème. Of course, other sushi chefs have mixed outside ideas into this essentially Japanese idiom. But Mr. Yoshida does it in a natural, unforced way that is very rare. A meal in his restaurant glides like a sliding door in its groove.”",2
Four Twenty Five,"“The announcement that the chef Jean-Georges Vongerichten was opening a restaurant in a glassy skyscraper on Park Avenue didn’t surprise me. A madly prolific international restaurateur, he seems to open restaurants like browser tabs (56 to date). My ears perked up when I heard that the new place, Four Twenty Five, was to be a haute cuisine restaurant, Mr. Vongerichten’s first in New York City since 1997, when he debuted the dizzyingly innovative, four-star Jean-Georges. But when I learned that the kitchen would be helmed by Jonathan Benno, the Per Se veteran whose own celebrated restaurants, Benno and Leonelli, sadly closed during the pandemic? That was a shock. Two megawatt celebrity chefs in one kitchen is practically unheard-of, besides being proverbially too many. And this particular pairing is doubly unexpected, because while Mr. Vongerichten is a notorious renegade, famous for his boldly spiced, Asian-inflected global cuisine, Mr. Benno is an ingredient-driven purist, hewing closer to French and Italian tradition. Translating all of these influences into a cohesive menu is a big challenge. Would their disparate styles emulsify, like wine and butter, into a beautiful beurre blanc? Or would the mixture break? At first glance, Four Twenty Five seems to be playing it safe. Fluke crudo, baby beets and winter squash agnolotti are all comfortingly familiar, verging on dull. You can order the obligatory Wagyu beef as a tenderloin or a strip steak, depending on your penchant for chewing and the depth of your pockets (the tenderloin is $84 and the strip is $118). Throw in the butter-poached lobster and caviar for the expense-account crowd, and pretty much all the usual boxes have been ticked. But Mr. Vongerichten and Mr. Benno are too exuberantly talented to leave it at that. And together, they’ve transformed a fine-dining punch list into an alchemically rich menu that goes to great lengths to seduce. Both crowd-pleasing and daring, it features food that amuses you, delights you, inspires you to explore corners of your appetite you didn’t know you had. Four Twenty Five is not a restaurant that forces you out of your comfort zone, but it doesn’t leave you stranded there, either, staring into your Chardonnay. The chefs shatter expectations every chance they get. They take fluke crudo, whose pale slices are usually eaten with a fork, and turn it into finger food. It arrives minced into a tartare, sharpened with citrus and softened with tahini, for you to roll into minty shiso leaves and eat by hand. The lobster goes in the other direction. Four Twenty Five’s preparation is based on Singaporean pepper crab, a pungent, saucy street food traditionally sucked sloppily out of the shells. Four Twenty Five has refined it into a sweet and buttery lobster dish you eat daintily with a fork. But it keeps the explosive sauce — an accelerant of peppercorns, fermented black beans, ginger and scallions whose high Scoville rating sears the sinuses, even as a dash of sweet soy soothes them again. Improbably, it’s the baby beets that steal the show. The plate may look a little froufrou, its mosaic of rosy, gold and scarlet scattered with lacy herbs and dabbed with clouds of coconut milk curd. The beets themselves, though, are extraordinary, every sphere maintaining a distinct character; some fruitlike and sweet, others earthy and juicy, some mild, some stronger. There are bits of apple, too, which you’d expect to be the sweetest element on the plate. But pickled in sherry vinegar, they’re tangy enough to make you squint, a bracing counterpoint to the symphonic earthiness of the beets. That forthright smack of acidity is all over the menu: a drizzle of Champagne vinegar dressing a retro peekytoe crab salad topped with fat rings of golden fried onions; yuzu, ginger and serrano blended into a verdant sauce for a thick puck of seared hake; a gorgeously pink duck breast with impossibly crisp skin, surrounded by a red curry mustard sauce spiked with the gentian slap of Suze liqueur. If you want to hunker down in your comfort zone, the pastas are a safe space. The agnolotti with winter squash, amaretti and brown butter is all sweet plushness, gently zhuzhed by the frizzled shiitake agrodolce, which snaps with that characteristic tang. It is impossible not to love. While slightly farther afield, the uni spaghetti is generously dolloped with pristine lobes of briny, creamy sea urchin that refreshes like an ocean plunge. It’s food that doesn’t just please, it woos. Four Twenty Five’s dishes go out of their way to meet you where you are before they lead you somewhere else. And just so no one is left out, most of the dishes are available at both dinner and lunch. Lunchtime is filled with hushed business negotiations and couture. Dinner is more of a scene. On a Thursday night in December, the double-height lounge area downstairs was lively with well-heeled holiday revelers. A noisy coterie of Midtown lawyers clustered around the bar, extending an office holiday party with olive oil-washed vodka martinis. A couple of chic, waifish scions with MoMA shopping bags mutely appraised the 24-foot Larry Poons painting above the bar, nursing foie gras-infused old-fashioneds. A multigenerational family lifted Champagne flutes to their patriarch in a tweed blazer. Each group was ushered in turn, like Wagnerian gods, up the sweeping, bronze-trimmed staircase to the restaurant’s. It’s a sophisticated, chic room, illuminated at night to a golden glow. At the center, giant, feathery, vaguely Seussian pink floral arrangements strike a whimsical note. Designed by Norman Foster, the décor was inspired by the Deco style of a 1930s ocean liner; you can imagine Barbara Stanwyck in a sparkly evening gown floating across the thick, silvery carpet. The desserts keep that buoyant glamour going. Swags of meringue top a Mont Blanc dacquoise with cassis and chestnut mousse; billowing banana Chantilly covers crème caramels; a profoundly bittersweet chocolate almond moelleux is scented with smoky black cardamom. Like the rest of the menu, Sydney Hursa’s desserts are intelligently conceived and designed to surprise — without losing any of their fun.”",2
Bungalow,"“Are we done with the butter-chicken era of Indian restaurants? With being asked to choose a spice level from 1 to 10 for entrees? With having to hear the redundant phrase “naan bread”? That’s what I wondered as I dunked a Parle-G biscuit into chai at Bungalow and noticed that the dining room was completely packed, the line to get in stretched down First Avenue and the bar was standing room only. It wasn’t always this way. When I began working in food journalism 11 years ago, the hard-to-get-into restaurants in New York City were usually Italian, French or “new American.” At these places, my friends and I were often the only people of color sitting in the dining room. We grew accustomed to being forgotten around mid-meal, or being seated next to the bathrooms. What a difference a decade makes. Some of the most coveted tables in New York today are at restaurants — like Semma and Dhamaka — serving lesser-known regional dishes from around India. Checking around last Friday, I could have landed a dinner reservation for four at coveted places like Lilia, Carbone and Torrisi in the next few weeks, but there wasn’t a single opening at Bungalow. The rise of regional Indian restaurants that draw big crowds and attention without cutting corners to please a non-South Asian audience — the owners of Semma and Dhamaka even named their company Unapologetic Foods — has been happening for several years. But Bungalow doesn’t need to declare its lack of apologies. This is a restaurant by South Asians, for South Asians, and if others want to join in, they’re welcome, too. On all three of my visits, the restaurant — a handsome space with ornate rugs and busy floral wallpaper that feels more like a stately ancestral home than a dining room — was filled primarily with people of South Asian descent. Influencers in cargo pants and jhumkas filmed themselves under a skylight covered in winding branches of faux jasmine. Besuited bros clinked glasses of Kashmiri chile-infused mezcal under brass chandeliers. Aunties in kurtas and Hokas lounged in suede banquettes, giving approving nods to the crisp shells of Banarasi puri filled with potatoes and tangy chutneys. Anyone with aunties knows they don’t give the nod unless they really mean it. That was my first indication that Bungalow is more than just another pretty place fronted by a celebrity chef — in this case, Vikas Khanna, who has hosted several television shows, including seven seasons of “MasterChef India,” a hit competition series with millions of viewers. His cooking is wildly interesting. The menu is a lesson in regional Indian food and the creative possibilities contained within it. It defies preconception or oversimplification, neither strictly traditional nor fusion. Mr. Khanna makes a version of galouti kebab, a silky-on-the-inside, crisp-on-the-outside patty from the northern city Lucknow. But he subs out the traditional mutton filling with mashed kidney beans, stuffs them between two slices of fried lotus root and serves it all atop walnut-radish raita. Think Oreo in structure, with an uncanny depth of flavor. Bungalow’s ghee roast, a dish in which meat is typically cooked in fat until meltingly tender, is built around plantains, enhancing their richness and sweetness. The peels are turned into a smooth, tangy ketchup that sings. Strained yogurt encased in shreds of kataifi and deep-fried — Mr. Khanna compared the technique to frying ice cream in dough — is unexpectedly, and pleasantly, as sweet as it is savory. There’s a deeply personal side to many dishes. An ode to Mr. Khanna’s childhood love of cream rolls arrives in a cone of puff pastry stuffed with an earthy-sweet shrimp balchao from Goa that’s stewed in coconut vinegar and tamarind paste, crowned with a crunchy curry leaf. And Ammi’s lamb chops, undergirded with sour mango powder, are pure primal satisfaction. This is the kind of cooking that may surprise even those who consider themselves familiar with Indian cuisine. It’s inviting, self-assured and just fun to eat. The media-savvy Mr. Khanna, who also co-founded the Manhattan restaurant Junoon, has the dining room wrapped around his finger. He greets each table, poses for selfies, signs cookbooks. He posts a photo of himself with a different restaurant guest on his Instagram account (4.9 million followers) seemingly every day. (He co-owns Bungalow with the restaurateur Jimmy Rizvi and two other partners.) Mr. Khanna recognized me as a food writer on my first visit, delivering each dish personally and delighting my mother with a sample of his homemade lemon pickle. So for my next meals, I went in disguise, and was encouraged to see him come by my table without knowing who I was, and even to verify that the seasoning on the Anarkali chicken, sticky with pomegranate, was just right. (It was.) To eat at Bungalow is to be reminded that Indian restaurants no longer need to cater to a white audience to find broad success. South Asian Americans have never been more visible or powerful in this country. They’re starring in movies, winning Grammy Awards and vying to become president and second lady. Who needs Michelin stars when you have Madhuri Dixit, one of the most famous Indian actresses in the world, dining in your restaurant (as she did on one of my visits)? Even the name, Bungalow, and its décor suggest a reclamation of a local term that was co-opted by the British for the structures they built during their occupation of India. (Or does it romanticize colonialism? Debates will ensue.) Bungalow is full of if-you-know-you-know touches: the robust use of Amul cheese, a funky favorite of the diaspora found in the delightfully gooey kulcha and the lamb kebab; the rattan chairs that recall your nani’s house; those black-and-white photos of unsmiling family members sitting in neat rows. Even the cocktails run on Indian standard time; on each of my visits, they arrived after I was already a few courses in. The magic fizzles when the food plays it safe. The chicken amrit, swimming in a creamy tomato gravy, was both overly rich and a little watery. The molten chocolate cake seemed too boring for the restaurant’s level of ambition. I wonder, too, what will happen if Mr. Khanna’s commitments as a TV chef mean he can’t be around every night to suffuse the dining room with his charm. Still, it’s hard to ignore that Bungalow attests to a seismic shift, one that I wish Floyd Cardoz, the Manhattan chef who opened Tabla a quarter-century ago and fought hard to win Indian food its due in the United States before his death in 2020, had been around to see. Indian cuisine has been many things in American culture: a monotonous takeout order, a detox treatment, an exoticized curiosity. Now, it gets to be itself.”",2
Penny,"“Chefs tend to load their first restaurants with every hope, dream, vision and idea they’ve ever had. It may not all come together, but if it comes close and if the ideas are any good, we can respond to the originality and overlook the weak spots. That was my reaction to Claud, which the chef Joshua Pinsky opened with Chase Sinzer two years ago in the East Village. I was so happy with the food coming out of the kitchen that I didn’t mind the disjointed layout, which sometimes left me wondering if I was sitting in the wrong place. I didn’t care, either, that it was hard to see a thread that tied together the homespun devil’s food layer cake and the tomato mille-feuille built from sheafs of puff pastry that any patisserie in Lyon would be proud to claim. Still, my review attempting to answer the question “What is Claud?” took up more than 1,000 words, and I’m not sure it ever got where it was going. Mr. Pinsky and Mr. Sinzer opened a second restaurant in March, directly above the first, up a short flight of iron stairs from the East 10th Street sidewalk. They named it Penny, and I can describe it in two words. It’s a seafood counter. With a few more words, I’ll tell you that the counter is comfortable and roomy, that seafood of one kind or another turns up in almost every item on the menu except the two desserts, and that it is handled with unusual sensitivity and clarity. Penny is a very good restaurant for many reasons, not the least of which is that it skates around so many of the little traps Claud fell into. I’m not trying to run down Claud, which is the more complex of the two and may be the more interesting. But Penny improves upon it in several ways, and that’s notable because restaurants that avoid the sophomore slump and manage not to come off as branding exercises are rare and getting rarer. Ian Chapin, the interior designer who broke Claud up into small, distinct dining areas, takes the opposite tack with Penny. One nearly continuous counter, made of fog-white marble with fat, smoke-colored veins, runs down the entire space, which is long and narrow, like a bocce court. Facing the counter are 31 stools, all the same and all very comfortable, with cushy leather seats and backs and metal footrests. By the front door are four spots at a shallow marble ledge built into the glass aquarium wall that looks out over the street. The ledge is big enough to hold a glass of wine and maybe half a dozen raw cherrystones or oysters, but if you want much more than that you should angle for a counter seat. While you can treat Penny as a raw bar, it is not the place to go when you want to study the salinity and creaminess of oysters from every cove and inlet along the East Coast. On any given night, they all come from one location. But there is a host of other chilled shellfish. Razor clams are decorated with tiny pickles of cauliflower and other vegetables; tuna carpaccio is sent out with crushed green olives and semicircles of cipollini onions, sharp and raw. Penny’s shrimp cocktail is worth a visit all by itself. Shrimp cocktail never really went out of style, but it has become something of a touchstone lately, a reassuring totem of the midcentury American gift for investing extremely plain food with glamour. Because it’s so simple, restaurants tend to make it carelessly or, at the other end of the spectrum, over-elaborately. The version at Penny is completely traditional, but it gets right all the details that most other places get wrong. It can be eaten on its own or as part of a sampler called the Ice Box, a metal tray of chipped iced that might also hold shucked clams and oysters, pickled mussels and sliced raw scallops under a terrific citrus-seaweed-chile dressing. Mr. Sinzer has said that he and Mr. Pinsky took some inspiration from Le Dauphin and L’Écailler du Bistrot in Paris, two seafood-focused offshoots opened just down the block from their chefs’ original restaurants, Le Chateaubriand and Le Bistrot Paul Bert. What Penny reminds me of are the seafood counters of Barcelona, such as Lluritu and Cal Pep. It’s not that the recipes are particularly Catalan or Spanish, although it’s easy to imagine a stall in the Boqueria serving Penny’s sliced octopus, pink with sweet pimentón and arranged over a potato salad bound by fried onions and mayonnaise. (How crisp cubes of smoked, pickled daikon got into the salad I’m not quite sure, but they’re a nice surprise.) And the wonderful grilled squid, stuffed with tuna and chard, is sauced with a spice oil that tastes a little like harissa and recalls the Moorish flavors in Spanish cooking. But a Catalan chef might find something familiar about the way Mr. Pinsky treats seafood — he doesn’t overcook it, seasons it with respect for its inherent flavors and serves it with confidence that its quality will be obvious to anyone who likes fish. Apart from Cantabrian anchovies, Penny doesn’t stock the tinned Spanish fish that you see now at so many counters around the city. (The anchovies can be served over a mound of salted butter to be eaten with a warm, sesame-sprinkled loaf of brioche.) Most of Penny’s seafood comes from the salt waters of the Northeast. The squid, the cod, the black sea bass that is served raw beside a lump of just-grated wasabi — all of it has that special freshness that you only get when everybody in the supply chain does their part, from the boat to the dock to the delivery truck. A lot of the shellfish are kept on beds of ice along the back of the bar, including lobsters, one of which will from time to time stir to life without warning before it’s hustled offstage. When it returns, it has been lightly poached and cracked open, the meat cut into bits that you stab with your fork and swish around in the brown butter pooled in the bottom of the bowl. I don’t know another restaurant in the city that has come closer to respecting the spirit of the steamed lobster with drawn butter that you can find on the shore from Maine to Connecticut, while cleaning it up and fine-tuning it and even improving it a bit. The puff pastry dough from Claud’s mille-feuille, or something like it, reappears as a golden beehive that is set above the elegant oyster pan roast, ready to shatter on contact with a knife. Made without cream or chile sauce, this pan roast looks and tastes nothing like the majestic one at the Grand Central Oyster Bar. Made with peas and bacon, it has more in common with a potpie; it’s uncategorizable and delicious. The sesame brioche is the only bread Penny serves; it’s so airy that it may not be the right bread. Penny doesn’t have any of the pastas or rice dishes that provide ballast at other seafood restaurants, and it’s possible to spend $100 or more on dinner and walk out feeling not quite full. And yet that brioche does double duty as the bread for an ice cream sandwich filled with a fat lump of vanilla ice cream and a few spoonfuls of barely cooked strawberry compote. It may be a tribute to the strawberry shortcake I’m always hoping for when I go to one of those beachside lobster shacks. Once in a while, I get lucky. That’s how the ice cream sandwich at Penny made me feel — lucky.”",2
Din Tai Fung,"“There was much excitement in the New York dumpling community when Din Tai Fung announced it would open an outpost in Manhattan — the Taiwanese restaurant chain’s 182nd opening worldwide and its 16th location in the United States, but the first one east of Las Vegas. In July, thousands of hopefuls kept vigil at their laptops to score reservations as they were released, only to watch them vanish in minutes. A dumpling lover faces long odds at Din Tai Fung. The first restaurant opened in 1972 in Taipei, specializing in xiao long bao, or Shanghai-style soup dumplings (also called steamed buns or juicy buns). As a global chain, it now offers a more expansive menu, but it’s still the xiao long bao that pull in the fans. Din Tai Fung’s famously dainty dumplings are regarded as paragons of the form. The xiao long bao, said to have originated in Nanxiang more than a century ago, is a balancing act of wrapper, filling and soup. Its nucleus, a loose-knit mound of fatty meat, is speckled with jellied cubes of chilled broth that must stay solid while being quickly wrapped. That wrapper can vary from translucent to fluffy, depending on the style. The jelly melts as the dumplings steam, filling them with hot, savory soup that cascades thrillingly across the tongue when you slurp. Precision and uniformity are the goal at Din Tai Fung, where each xiao long bao weighs exactly 21 grams, the gossamer wrappers pleated 18 times. At the New York branch you can watch the dumpling makers speedily rolling, pinching, stuffing and twisting the dough in a glassed-in prep room. A team of about 34 chefs produces an astonishing 16,000 dumplings a day, and over the course of five visits I’ve become obsessed with trying to get one of the good ones. Because despite Din Tai Fung’s obsession for detail, I’ve found the Manhattan restaurant wildly, frustratingly inconsistent. I got the ideal experience on my first visit, in August. I brought a group of Din Tai Fung devotees, one of whom had stayed up late to pounce on a 7 p.m. reservation. (If you go to bed early you’ll have to dine on dumplings in the afternoon.) As befits the restaurant’s location on Broadway just north of Times Square, the setting is dramatic, the white-clad prep chefs fluttering like moths against the dark plums, browns and blacks of the elegant dining room. This is reportedly the most upscale of the chain, but it’s also dim and disorienting, with a mazelike layout that can be hard to navigate. The labyrinth echoed boisterously with couples on dates, families with young children, blasé locals and chirruping tourists. Our party of four was seated at a round table big enough for six, which we quickly crowded with too much food. Small plates of vegetables came first: snappy cabbage, silky spinach and crisp green beans suffused with garlic; floppy curls of vinegary wood-ear mushrooms; a pyramid of chile-dotted cucumber rounds. All proved reliably excellent on every visit. The noodles, too, were very fine, especially the egg-yellow strands in fragrant Taiwanese soup with wobbly chunks of braised beef. And at last, our reason for coming appeared: bamboo towers of xiao long bao, shao mai and steamed buns. I lifted a pork xiao long bao, its taut skin bulging with heady, savory soup, and eased it tenderly into a wide porcelain spoon. Mindful of the instructions placed on every table to prevent newbies from staining their shirts, I dabbed ginger and vinegar on top, nibbled a hole in the swirled knot and blew on it carefully. I slurped, and I understood. The non-soup dumplings were nearly as impressive, including plump wontons in a fiery dressing, pink kimchi-pork dumplings that exploded with gorgeous funk, and chewy, earthy black sesame dumplings dunked in frothy sea salt cream. By the time I left, lips slick with soup, I was prepared to wait at my laptop as long as it took to get another reservation.A few weeks later, a friend and I arrived for an early reservation at the bar. After a 25-minute stint in the purgatorial waiting area, we were seated in front of a bored-looking bartender shaking lychee mojitos and an acid green Elphaba’s Elixir (a tie-in with the musical “Wicked”) for a raucous pre-theater crowd. The xiao long bao, when they finally arrived, were deflated and slack, having leaked puddles in their basket, and the dribbles of soup left inside the skins were hardly enough to moisten the chalky meat. Cod-filled dumplings were so bland my friend asked to have them boxed up to take back for her sick dog (four stars from the dog). Shanghai-style rice cakes were threaded with hard nubs of overcooked shrimp and not much by way of seasoning. On my next two visits, the food ranged from quite good (the pork sticky-rice wrap) to lackluster (oddly odorless truffle dumplings) to awful (soggy pork chops, wan noodles, watery soups). A friend who’s a regular at Din Tai Fung in Los Angeles quipped that this was more like a P.F. Chang’s. Still, a xiao long bao lover who works in Midtown can dream. I tried again, waiting until mid-October to give the restaurant time to work out the kinks. I snagged a table for 4:30 p.m. on a Tuesday and brought dumpling connoisseurs with whom I’d savored xiao long bao in Flushing one brothy night. My luck improved, if only a little. The xiao long bao were in decent form, and the green vegetables were, as always, delightfully garlicky. (Give that vegetable chef a raise.) We skipped the reliably dull fried rice dishes, but were pleased with the spicy noodles, which, with a glossy, fiery sauce, lived up to their name. But none of it was as good as in August. Nor were the xiao long bao any better than the many other soup dumplings in town that are much less expensive. At their best, Din Tai Fung’s are like beautifully wrapped gifts, the steaming soup and tender meat exhilarating every time. But too often, biting into them was like tearing into a beautifully wrapped package only to find a pair of crumpled gym socks inside. From everything I know about Din Tai Fung, it’s a safe bet that someone, in some location, is enjoying a perfect xiao long bao. If you want to try your luck at the New York branch, there’s a small chance it could be you.”",1
Coqodaq,"“Coqodaq is a six-month-old, 8,000-square-foot restaurant on East 22nd Street that may remind you, at various points in the evening, of an airplane hangar, a church, a roller disco, a Las Vegas casino and a Quonset hut. At times it seems like the first in a new species of restaurant, and at others it seems like the end of civilization. It may be the most interesting place to open in Manhattan since the start of pandemic, in part because it can be so many things at once without being especially good. Oh, it’s fine. You can have a good time there, particularly if you like eating Korean fried chicken out of a bucket. There are other things on the menu, but the chicken in a bucket comes with a cup of chicken-ginseng consommé, plus cubes of pickled daikon and other banchan plates, plus cold capellini sprinkled with perilla seeds, plus a slaw of slivered scallions, and at the end there’s soft-serve fro-yo with blueberry sauce, à la Pinkberry. All this costs $38, a pretty decent deal. The menu calls the whole shebang the Bucket List, in red type that’s larger than anything else on the page except the restaurant’s name. At the end of the word “list” is a little trademark symbol. The name also has a subtitle: “Our Chef’s Signature Fried Chicken Feast.” There is a drawing of the bucket that is even bigger than the words Bucket List. The bucket seems to float in front of a sunburst of light, like Jesus ascending to heaven in a Renaissance painting. Before taking your order, one of the servers will tell you that the Bucket List is “a great way to experience our food,” or something along those lines. In case I hadn’t figured out that Coqodaq is serious about pushing the Bucket List, I would have figured it out when I asked whether I could get one of the other buckets on the menu — the fried-vegetable bucket or the fish-and-chips bucket — while everybody else at the table was getting the regular Bucket List, and I was told, “Only if you have a food allergy or dietary restriction.” That seems like a hard rule to enforce, so I took my chances and asked for the fish-and-chips bucket. Nobody asked for a note from my allergist. The fish turned out to be monkfish in golden chunks that I ate happily in about three bites apiece. The chips were French fries that are freshly cut and fried twice. Coqodaq’s fish and chips might be my favorite thing on the menu. The restaurant is owned by Simon Kim, who also runs Cote Korean Steakhouse, a quick walk west on 22nd Street. Cote is a cross between a Korean barbecue restaurant and an American steakhouse. It isn’t the city’s best example of either genre, but it’s extremely successful at luring customers who might not go to a straight-up steakhouse or a pure Korean barbecue spot. Positioning it as a steakhouse probably helps it sell a lot more red wine than you typically see at the restaurants on Northern Boulevard or 32nd Street. What Cote did to galbi and anchangsal, Coqodaq does to the irresistibly crisp South Korean way of frying chicken. As in Seoul, Los Angeles, New York and hundreds of other cities that have embraced Korean fried chicken, Coqodaq serves the pieces plain or varnished, painted with a glossy soy sauce or a reddish gochujang glaze. Another thing Coqodaq really wants you to get, besides the Bucket List, is Champagne. It claims to stock more Champagnes than any restaurant in the United States, around 400 bottles at last count. A note on the drinks list calls Champagne and chicken “A Match Made in Heaven.” To underscore the point, there is a drawing of a pyramid of Champagne coupes floating in the clouds, with more of that Jesus light behind it. Champagne is a great match for fried chicken. So is beer, the standard pairing in South Korea. So, for that matter, are iced tea and lemonade. But Mr. Kim seems to understand that spending money on Champagne fits the city’s weird, giddy, and-the-band-played-on mood. One of several Winston Churchill lines about Champagne was, “In victory I deserve it; in defeat I need it.” New Yorkers aren’t sure which one applies to them — they’re still celebrating the end of the pandemic and now they’re freaking out about the election. Coqodaq isn’t the first restaurant in the city with a fried-chicken-and-Champagne theme. Birds and Bubbles, which ran on the Lower East Side from 2014 to 2017, built the concept right into its name. I don’t remember feeling that I was being upsold there the way I often did at Coqodaq, maybe because Birds & Bubbles was smaller and more intimate. With about 150 seats indoors, Coqodaq is anything but intimate. High tables are lined up by the front windows for walk-ins, and a double-barreled arrangement of banquettes and booths for people with reservations recedes into the distance, spanned by a series of glass arches that glow with a coppery light. The design, by Rockwell Group, is obviously alluding to the rib vaults of Gothic cathedrals, but it also made me think of the golden arches of McDonald’s. The chicken buckets and the honey-mustard dipping sauce that comes with them had already put me in a fast-food frame of mind. So did the Golden Nuggets (also written with a trademark symbol), which the kitchen makes from scratch by sticking bits and pieces of chicken together and molding them by hand, so every nugget looks the same. They’re much better than McNuggets without being delicious, exactly. Not that you’re supposed to eat them on their own. Coqodaq sells them loaded with spoonfuls of ocean trout roe ($16 for a nugget) or sturgeon caviar ($28). The Golden Nugget, like the restaurant, displays a calculating shrewdness in the name of fun. The dish exploits our sentimental nostalgia for the chain restaurants of childhood along with our suspicion that the future will be worse than the present, so we’d better live it up while we can, and compresses them into a single, bite-size piece of Instagram bait. The end-times indulgence might be more entertaining if the food weren’t obvious and pandering. Seung Kyu Kim, Coqodaq’s chef and a partner, is clearly skilled. His kitchen does an impressive job of keeping up with a large and voluble crowd that files in almost as soon as the doors open at 5 p.m. and doesn’t start to thin out until 11 or so. But he pushes the salt and sugar in his cooking to the limits and sometimes beyond. The chicken consommé was almost briny one night, as the chicken guksu was on another. Korean kitchens often deliberately undersalt chicken poached with ginseng, and one of the pleasures of eating it is the contrast between the bland meat and the salt crystals you add at the table. This is the kind of nuance that Coqodaq strips out in its pursuit of crossover success. In the chilled capellini, you taste sugar more than you taste the perilla seeds, and the tteokbokki are slick with a one-dimensional gochujang sauce that’s far more sweet than spicy. Maybe the overuse of salt and sugar is supposed to be some kind of statement about fast food and the ways cuisines from other countries are assimilated in the United States, but it flattens Korean dishes and makes them one-dimensional. The paradox is that if the food were a little more subtle, it might taste a lot better with Champagne.”",1
Peter Luger Steakhouse,"“I can count on Peter Luger Steak House in Brooklyn to produce certain sensations at every meal. There is the insistent smell of broiled dry-aged steak that hits me the minute I open the door and sometimes sooner, while I’m still outside on the South Williamsburg sidewalk, producing a raised pulse, a quickening of the senses and a restlessness familiar to anyone who has seen a tiger that has just heard the approach of the lunch bucket. There is the hiss of butter and melted tallow as they slide down the hot platter, past the sliced porterhouse or rib steak and their charred bones, to make a pool at one end. The server will spoon some of this sizzling fat over the meat he has just plated, generally with some line like “Here are your vitamins.” There is the thunk of a bowl filled with schlag landing on a bare wood table when dessert is served, and soon after, the softer tap-tap-tap of waxy chocolate coins in gold foil dropped one at a time on top of the check. And after I’ve paid, there is the unshakable sense that I’ve been scammed. The last sensation was not part of the Peter Luger experience when I started eating there, in the 1990s. I was acutely aware of the cost back then because I would settle the tab by counting out $20 bills; cash was the only way to pay unless you had a Peter Luger credit card. At the end of the night my wallet would be empty. Because a Peter Luger steak made me feel alive in a way that few other things did, I considered this a fair trade, although I could afford it only once a year or so. I don’t remember when the doubts began, but they grew over time. Diners who walk in the door eager to hand over literal piles of money aren’t greeted; they’re processed. A host with a clipboard looks for the name, or writes it down and quotes a waiting time. There is almost always a wait, with or without a reservation, and there is almost always a long line of supplicants against the wall. A kind word or reassuring smile from somebody on staff would help the time pass. The smile never comes. The Department of Motor Vehicles is a block party compared with the line at Peter Luger. The management seems to go out of its way to make things inconvenient. Customers at the bar have to order drinks from the bartender and food from an overworked server on the other side of the bar, and then pay two separate checks and leave two separate tips. And they can’t order lunch after 2:30 p.m., even though the bar and the kitchen remain open. Since its last, two-star review in the Times, written by Frank Bruni in 2007, the restaurant has started taking online reservations. It accepts debit cards, too, which is nice. But the credit card you use to buy a cortado at the cafe or a bag of chips at the bodega will still not buy you a meal at Peter Luger. The servers, who once were charmingly brusque, now give the strong impression that these endless demands for food and drink are all that’s standing between them and a hard-earned nap. Signals that a customer has a question or request don’t get picked up as quickly; the canned jokes about spinach and schlag don’t flow as freely. Although the fries are reasonably crisp, their insides are mealy and bland in a way that fresh-cut potatoes almost certainly would not be. The sole — yes, I’m the person who ordered the sole at Peter Luger — was strangely similar: The bread crumbs on top were gold and crunchy, but the fish underneath was dry and almost powdery. Was the Caesar salad always so drippy, the croutons always straight out of a bag, the grated cheese always so white and rubbery? I know there was a time the German fried potatoes were brown and crunchy, because I eagerly ate them each time I went. Now they are mushy, dingy, gray and sometimes cold. I look forward to them the way I look forward to finding a new, irregularly shaped mole. Lunch one afternoon vividly demonstrated the kitchen’s inconsistency: I ordered a burger, medium-rare, at the bar. So had the two people sitting to my right, it turned out. One of them got what we’d all asked for, a midnight-dark crust giving way to an evenly rosy interior so full of juices it looked like it was ready to cry. The other one got a patty that was almost completely brown inside. I got a weird hybrid, a burger whose interior shaded from nearly perfect on one side to gray and hard on the other. The same issue afflicted a medium-rare porterhouse I was served one night: The fillet was ideal but the other side of the T-bone, the strip, ranged from medium-rare to medium-well. I could live with this; big cuts of meat don’t always cook evenly. What gnaws at me every time I eat a Luger porterhouse is the realization that it’s just another steak, and far from the best New York has to offer. Other restaurants, and not just steakhouses, can put a formidable crust on both sides of the cut; Luger caramelizes the top side only, while the underside is barely past raw, as if it had done all its cooking on the hot platter. Other restaurants, and not just steakhouses, buy beef that is tender, richly marbled and deeply flavorful; at Luger, you get the first two but not the third. Other restaurants, and not just steakhouses, age that beef to make flavor grow and intensify and double back on itself; dry-aging at Luger still results in a tender steak, but it rarely achieves a hypnotic or compelling or even very interesting one. But those other restaurants are not Peter Luger, as Friedrich Nietzsche might have said. “When in this essay I declare war upon Wagner,” Nietzsche wrote in “The Case of Wagner,” “the last thing I want to do is start a celebration for any other musicians. Other musicians don’t count compared to Wagner.” I could say the same thing about other steakhouses — compared to Peter Luger, they don’t count. Luger is not the city’s oldest, but it’s the one in which age, tradition, superb beef, blistering heat, an instinctive avoidance of anything fancy and an immensely attractive self-assurance came together to produce something that felt less like a restaurant than an affirmation of life, or at least life as it is lived in New York City. This sounds ridiculously grand. Years ago I thought it was true, though, and so did other people. The restaurant will always have its loyalists. They will laugh away the prices, the $16.95 sliced tomatoes that taste like 1979, the $229.80 porterhouse for four. They will say that nobody goes to Luger for the sole, nobody goes to Luger for the wine, nobody goes to Luger for the salad, nobody goes to Luger for the service. The list goes on, and gets harder to swallow, until you start to wonder who really needs to go to Peter Luger, and start to think the answer is nobody.”",1
ILIS,"“The most talked-about dish at ILIS, the cavernous Brooklyn restaurant opened by the Danish-born chef Mads Refslund in October, has to be the clam flask. This is a drinking vessel made by opening a surf clam, removing the clam, resealing the halves of the shell and shearing off a bit of the top lip to create a small opening through which you sip the liquid inside. When I first had the clam flask, it was filled with a blend of tomato juice and dried-clam broth that tasted something like a virgin Caesar cocktail. The contents, though, are not what has captured everybody’s attention. The reason everybody remembers the flask is that it is tightly bound and knotted with twine, like a corset designed for bivalves with a taste for mild kink. Mr. Refslund’s cooks must spend a good part of the workweek at the arts-and-crafts station. An Okinawan sweet potato is presented in a fluted tart shell molded from beeswax. Chopped whelk in potato foam is nestled inside the shell and is eaten with a birch stick lashed to an operculum, the part of the whelk that normally seals the shell’s opening and looks something like a guitar pick. This use of natural materials in the kitchen is one of the hallmarks of the New Nordic style that Mr. Refslund helped found, and the handmade pieces at ILIS have a certain spooky pagan beauty. They cast a spell over all my meals there, a daydreamy state so pleasant that I didn’t want to admit that many of the dishes weren’t really landing the way they should. A similar spell must have fallen over the writers and influencers who have been talking about ILIS as if it were a New York City branch of Noma. It’s far from that. Mr. Refslund and René Redzepi served as co-chefs of Noma when it opened in 2003 in Copenhagen. After about six months, they agreed that they weren’t cut out to work together, and Mr. Refslund left. He doesn’t try to claim credit for what Noma became, but a lot of people in New York seem eager to give it to him. The food at ILIS doesn’t resemble any of the dishes I ate at Noma six years ago, each of which pulsed with flavor and originality and was as satisfying as a great pop song or short story. Some of the cooking at ILIS is heading in that direction, but a lot of it tastes wispy and unfinished. The people comparing ILIS to Noma almost act as if Mr. Refslund and New Nordic cuisine itself were both new to the city. In fact, 12 years ago he was the opening chef of Acme, the restaurant that really did give the city its first taste of the naturalistic, intricate new style. (Not long after, Fredrik Berselius opened the pop-up version of Aska, which has grown into the most impressive local showcase for that cuisine.) Some items on that menu were forerunners of dishes at ILIS. Ollebrod, a yeasty Danish porridge of dark beer and rye bread, has appeared on the dessert lineup at both restaurants, and so has some version of a granita made from wheatgrass juice. As he did at Acme, Mr. Refslund builds his menu at ILIS from regional ingredients, but his knowledge of what’s available locally has grown considerably. New Nordic cuisine is less a regional style than a belief system that can be applied almost anywhere. One of its tenets is that we’re surrounded by a vast catalog of wild foods far beyond the small handful of domesticated plants and animals that make up most European and American diets. In recent weeks the kitchen at ILIS was playing around with blood clams, their hemoglobin-rich juices gathered around them in an alarming red pool; Japanese knotweed, an invasive species that will quickly choke any lot where it takes root but, when picked young enough, tastes tart and fresh; or propeller-like maple seedlings clinging together in purple clusters. There’s a good chance you’ll run into something new at ILIS, though some of these discoveries are more exciting than others. I was genuinely happy to be introduced, by way of a whole roasted breast and skewers of grilled kofta made from the legs, to the deep flavor of Khaki Campbell ducks, a mallard hybrid that yields leaner and more intensely flavored meat than many other farm-raised ducks. On the other hand, if I don’t gnaw on another raw knotweed shoot until next spring, that will be fine with me. Each time I ordered sea scallops, servers let me know that they enter the kitchen alive and whole, with their roe. But the sweetness you hope to get from very fresh scallops never quite materialized, whether they were served raw with new spring peas or steamed with dashi and oil made from the roe. Some courses are almost pure theater. When the sweet potato arrives, a server pours hot beeswax over it and then inverts an hourglass egg timer. This is supposed to signal when the potato is ready to eat, but the heat from a thin coat of wax can’t possibly be strong enough to finish cooking a whole sweet potato. Once this ritual is over, the potato is sliced in half and a big lump of caviar is dropped on one half. You’re supposed to eat the other half with salt. Salt and caviar will make almost any potato taste good, and this one is unusually creamy, its purple flesh as dense and soft as a ripe nectarine, but the jazz-hands presentation oversells it. Then there is the whole cauliflower brought to the table in the pig’s bladder in which it is cooked. This is a version of a famous French chicken dish, an early method of sous-vide cooking that uses the bladder to seal in moisture so the chicken steams in its own juices. Cauliflower doesn’t have juices, though. Mr. Refslund adds a seaweed stock to the bladder for seasoning and then spoons herb vinaigrette over the florets, but when the bladder is carried to your table and snipped open with scissors, what comes out still tastes like steamed cauliflower. It’s true that ILIS has served me some of the most memorable dishes I’ve eaten in a long time. I was kind of blown away by the bigeye tuna loin cured in seaweed and salt for months and then sliced thin like aged ham, which the fish resembles in its vivid pink color and focused intensity. I am fascinated by the exceptionally silky raw-milk cheese that the kitchen makes each day and accented one night with shaved asparagus and pickled lily bulbs. And many of the things that came off the grill were riveting, including the sea bream brushed with black-olive sauce and Texas antelope speared on a stick with wild-boar lardo. With a dish like that in your hands, you can believe that you really are in one of the best new restaurants of the past year. Then you find yourself wondering why the liquid in the clam flask is tepid, even though it’s served on ice; why the scallops aren’t as sweet as they could be; why the brussels sprouts that accompany grilled brown trout are so weird and gloppy. ILIS isn’t the American Noma, and it’s not meant to be. It could become something important, though, if the cooking ever gets to be as dramatic as the stagecraft.”",1
Made Nice,"“New Yorkers will have more idle hours on their hands, or at least more time to watch otter videos at work, if Made Nice turns out to be the future of dining in New York. The food appears within 10 minutes from the moment you walk through the door on West 28th Street. Before that happens, you choose one of the eight or so main courses pictured on the wall, give your order to an extroverted host who taps it into a hand-held screen, and mill around the silverware and condiment station until you hear your name and are handed your meal on a charcoal-colored tray that doubles as a place mat. This routine may sound familiar and indeed it is, being the basic model of fast-casual restaurants from Shake Shack on down. Made Nice has nipped and tucked the formula all around, but the biggest difference is what’s on the tray. It’s not a burger or a grain bowl but a multicolored, photogenic and meticulously arranged plate that bears at least a familial resemblance to the cooking at Eleven Madison Park and the NoMad. Like those two restaurants, Made Nice is under the ownership and direction of the chef Daniel Humm and his collaborator, Will Guidara. To bring some of their usual meticulous care and a few glimmers of their artistry to a high-speed operation is the trick Made Nice is trying to pull off. To do so, the two owners have requisitioned a sous-chef from Eleven Madison Park, Danny DiStefano, to run the enormous kitchen, while Mr. Humm waves his magic wand somewhere offstage. As trays loaded with salad-like dishes leave the counter, you can glimpse bits and pieces of the two more formal restaurants flying by, like the scraps of Kansas that Dorothy sees caught in the twister. Look — it’s the NoMad chicken! And isn’t that the pork confit from Eleven Madison Park? Well, no, not really, as you will discover when you sit down and eat. The Made Nice confit doesn’t have the creaminess or the concentrated delicacy that suckling pig gives the original, or the golden roof of crisp skin. It’s a dark brick of shredded pork, a heavy-tasting and oddly inert centerpiece for a summer salad of shaved corn, watercress and wheat berries. Served at night and on Saturdays, the chicken is the only major dish at Made Nice that could not even by the most elastic definition be called a salad. With a bread stuffing under its browned skin, it does resemble the NoMad chicken from a distance. But the one at NoMad tastes as if it comes from some lost island where the gene that controls delicious chicken flavor has been passed down intact for centuries. The Made Nice chicken, by contrast, is ordinary — moist without being juicy, as if all its flavor had leaked out of the meat in order to make the stuffing as gummy as possible. The price is $22 for half a chicken and skinny fries. The fries are very good. Nobody should be surprised when a stripped-down dish that can be ready in five minutes and costs, on average, about $14 isn’t as wonderful as one that was fluffed to greatness for its role in a $295 tasting menu. It’s not a fair fight, yet it’s one that Mr. Humm and Mr. Guidara have invited by trying to link their fast-casual business with their other restaurants. But some of the food at Made Nice doesn’t just suffer by comparison; it can also suffer all on its own. The curried cauliflower is said to be a callout to another standby at the NoMad. I don’t remember trying it there, so I can’t say whether it’s so unevenly cooked that some pieces are brown and collapsed while others are white, crunchy and barely cooked. That’s how the cauliflower at Made Nice was, though. It tasted nothing like a real curry, and only a little bit like curry powder. Another dish is called chicken rice. The rice tastes like tomatoes and needs salt. The chicken seems exhausted. Imagine a chain of Cuban restaurants started by retired employees of the Olive Garden. This could be their arroz con pollo. Of the nine major dishes on the current menu, there are three I would be happy to eat again. One is a salad of watermelon and quinoa that has just enough twists and turns to stand out, like crisp pistachios and soft, creamy feta. Another, seared hanger steak slices over roasted broccoli that is chopped and seasoned with lime, may not sound like a winning combination, but it is. A third is smoked salmon salad whose croutons are, in fact, little fried cubes of shredded potato. Actually, there is a fourth dish worth revisiting, though I wouldn’t try to make a meal of it: the milk and honey sundae. The ice cream is soft serve — milk, uncontaminated by vanilla — strewn with a variety of fun, crunchy bits made from milk or honey. It’s $6. The sundae combines sophistication and pleasure better than anything else on the menu. It is also the only item you can’t get delivered. I suspect these things may be related. That enormous kitchen wasn’t built solely to feed the 30 or so people who can be seated in the restaurant. It was designed to handle a tall pile of takeout and delivery orders. So, in fact, were the recipes. Aside from the sundae, everything is engineered to look and taste almost as good after being sealed with a plastic lid, packed into a bag and carted 10 blocks. The explosion of delivery services has entranced chefs of all sorts. New York restaurants that would have hung up on you 10 years ago if you’d called for a delivery order — Mission Chinese Food, Hearth, DB Bistro Moderne, Santina, most of the Momofukus — are now, like Made Nice, signed up with Caviar. Others use services such as GrubHub, DoorDash and Postmates. According to one projection cited by The Atlantic, the market for delivery orders placed online will have grown 15 times faster than the rest of the restaurant business by the end of the decade. Meanwhile, restaurants across the country are anxiously watching as foot traffic falls at lunch and dinner. These twin trends have created a new and nearly invisible kind of restaurant with no dining room, just a commissary kitchen that fulfills orders to go. They’re called ghost restaurants. Made Nice seems to be something different. Its small dining room is merely the tip of a much bigger operation lurking below the surface. It’s an iceberg restaurant. To test it out, I ate one of my three Made Nice meals at The New York Times Building. My order showed up about a minute late, which counts as early given Midtown rush-hour traffic, and was pretty much as advertised. The fried chicken skins that are supposed to be scattered over the gravy-like chicken velouté didn’t show up, and a caper-dill relish that the menu said came with the tuna niçoise was smeared on the pork confit and the cod Provençal as well. Nothing was hot after about 30 minutes in transit. But the cooked items were still warm, the lettuce and other raw ingredients hadn’t wilted, and all the plates looked as if they had been primped by a food stylist for an overhead shot. Eating food like this at your desk would not feel like a complete surrender. Eating it in a restaurant is another story. Whether the same recipes can suit both experiences is the question Made Nice asks. Your own answer will depend on whether you are hoping for food that is quick, inexpensive and as delicious as you would expect from one of the city’s best-known chefs, or are willing to settle for two out of three.”",1
Guy's American Kitchen and Bar,"“GUY FIERI, have you eaten at your new restaurant in Times Square? Have you pulled up one of the 500 seats at Guy’s American Kitchen & Bar and ordered a meal? Did you eat the food? Did it live up to your expectations? Did panic grip your soul as you stared into the whirling hypno wheel of the menu, where adjectives and nouns spin in a crazy vortex? When you saw the burger described as “Guy’s Pat LaFrieda custom blend, all-natural Creekstone Farm Black Angus beef patty, LTOP (lettuce, tomato, onion + pickle), SMC (super-melty-cheese) and a slathering of Donkey Sauce on garlic-buttered brioche,” did your mind touch the void for a minute? Did you notice that the menu was an unreliable predictor of what actually came to the table? Were the “bourbon butter crunch chips” missing from your Almond Joy cocktail, too? Was your deep-fried “boulder” of ice cream the size of a standard scoop? What exactly about a small salad with four or five miniature croutons makes Guy’s Famous Big Bite Caesar (a) big (b) famous or (c) Guy’s, in any meaningful sense? Were you struck by how very far from awesome the Awesome Pretzel Chicken Tenders are? If you hadn’t come up with the recipe yourself, would you ever guess that the shiny tissue of breading that exudes grease onto the plate contains either pretzels or smoked almonds? Did you discern any buttermilk or brine in the white meat, or did you think it tasted like chewy air? Why is one of the few things on your menu that can be eaten without fear or regret — a lunch-only sandwich of chopped soy-glazed pork with coleslaw and cucumbers — called a Roasted Pork Bahn Mi, when it resembles that item about as much as you resemble Emily Dickinson? When you have a second, Mr. Fieri, would you see what happened to the black bean and roasted squash soup we ordered? Hey, did you try that blue drink, the one that glows like nuclear waste? The watermelon margarita? Any idea why it tastes like some combination of radiator fluid and formaldehyde? At your five Johnny Garlic’s restaurants in California, if servers arrive with main courses and find that the appetizers haven’t been cleared yet, do they try to find space for the new plates next to the dirty ones? Or does that just happen in Times Square, where people are used to crowding? If a customer shows up with a reservation at one of your two Tex Wasabi’s outlets, and the rest of the party has already been seated, does the host say, “Why don’t you have a look around and see if you can find them?” and point in the general direction of about 200 seats? What is going on at this new restaurant of yours, really? Has anyone ever told you that your high-wattage passion for no-collar American food makes you television’s answer to Calvin Trillin, if Mr. Trillin bleached his hair, drove a Camaro and drank Boozy Creamsicles? When you cruise around the country for your show “Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives,” rasping out slangy odes to the unfancy places where Americans like to get down and greasy, do you really mean it? Or is it all an act? Is that why the kind of cooking you celebrate on television is treated with so little respect at Guy’s American Kitchen & Bar? How, for example, did Rhode Island’s supremely unhealthy and awesomely good fried calamari — dressed with garlic butter and pickled hot peppers — end up in your restaurant as a plate of pale, unsalted squid rings next to a dish of sweet mayonnaise with a distant rumor of spice? How did Louisiana’s blackened, Cajun-spiced treatment turn into the ghostly nubs of unblackened, unspiced white meat in your Cajun Chicken Alfredo? How did nachos, one of the hardest dishes in the American canon to mess up, turn out so deeply unlovable? Why augment tortilla chips with fried lasagna noodles that taste like nothing except oil? Why not bury those chips under a properly hot and filling layer of melted cheese and jalapeños instead of dribbling them with thin needles of pepperoni and cold gray clots of ground turkey? By the way, would you let our server know that when we asked for chai, he brought us a cup of hot water? When you hung that sign by the entrance that says, WELCOME TO FLAVOR TOWN!, were you just messing with our heads? Does this make it sound as if everything at Guy’s American Kitchen & Bar is inedible? I didn’t say that, did I? Tell me, though, why does your kitchen sabotage even its more appealing main courses with ruinous sides and sauces? Why stifle a pretty good bison meatloaf in a sugary brown glaze with no undertow of acid or spice? Why send a serviceable herb-stuffed rotisserie chicken to the table in the company of your insipid Rice-a-Roni variant? Why undermine a big fist of slow-roasted pork shank, which might fly in many downtown restaurants if the General Tso’s-style sauce were a notch less sweet, with randomly shaped scraps of carrot that combine a tough, nearly raw crunch with the deadened, overcooked taste of school cafeteria vegetables? Is this how you roll in Flavor Town? Somewhere within the yawning, three-level interior of Guy’s American Kitchen & Bar, is there a long refrigerated tunnel that servers have to pass through to make sure that the French fries, already limp and oil-sogged, are also served cold? What accounts for the vast difference between the Donkey Sauce recipe you’ve published and the Donkey Sauce in your restaurant? Why has the hearty, rustic appeal of roasted-garlic mayonnaise been replaced by something that tastes like Miracle Whip with minced raw garlic? And when we hear the words Donkey Sauce, which part of the donkey are we supposed to think about? Is the entire restaurant a very expensive piece of conceptual art? Is the shapeless, structureless baked alaska that droops and slumps and collapses while you eat it, or don’t eat it, supposed to be a representation in sugar and eggs of the experience of going insane? Why did the toasted marshmallow taste like fish? Did you finish that blue drink? Oh, and we never got our Vegas fries; would you mind telling the kitchen that we don’t need them? Thanks.”",0
Harry Ciprani,"“OVER the years the Cipriani restaurant family and its employees have faced charges of sexual harassment, insurance fraud and tax evasion, the last leading to guilty pleas by two family members in July. But the crime that comes to mind first when I think of the Ciprianis is highway robbery. Based on my recent experience, that’s what happens almost any time Harry Cipriani on Fifth Avenue serves lunch or dinner. In this gleaming room in the Sherry-Netherland hotel, the Ciprianis charge $22.95 for asparagus vinaigrette — 12 medium-size spears, neither white, truffle-flecked nor even Parmesan-bedecked — and $34.95 for an appetizer of fried calamari. That’s at dinnertime, I should clarify. At lunch there’s a whopping $1 discount per dish. A dinner entree of fritto misto costs $48.95, even though it amounted to an extra-large portion of fried calamari with a few decorative shrimp and token scallops strewn, to negligible effect, among the generic calamari rings. I assure you of the accuracy of those numbers, and of these: $66.95 for a sirloin, $36.95 for lasagna, $18.95 for minestrone. It’s tempting to devote the rest of this review to a price list. Nothing else I can present is nearly as compelling. Besides, prices are the point of Harry Cipriani, which exists to affirm its patrons’ ability to throw away money. It’s the epitome of a restaurant whose steep tariffs justify themselves, subbing for membership dues and assuring that the spouse, in-law, client or canine psychic being treated to a $16.95 piece of chocolate cake will be impressed. Regulars accept and revel in this, or have bit by bit deluded themselves into believing that the $36.95 spaghetti with tomato and basil has something special to recommend it. (Trust me: it doesn’t.) But what of the uninitiated New Yorker or innocent tourist who sees the Cipriani name, with its connotations of extravagant banquets and extraordinary privilege, and waltzes through the doors expecting something magnificent in return for a king’s ransom? These victims in the offing deserve a heads-up on what they’re likely to find, which is service so confused and food so undistinguished it wouldn’t pass muster at half the cost. During one of my dinners, servers first tried to deliver another table’s veal chop to ours, then began to deliver our entrees before they had cleared our appetizers. Another night servers gave me rabbit although I had asked for duck, and then, after a profuse apology, neglected to bring my companions and me one of our desserts. But what I remember most vividly about that particular night is the potatoes. And I hasten to add that I’m taking it on faith that they were potatoes. That’s what they visually suggested, those desiccated yellow-beige coins that had somehow acquired the texture of Brillo and could almost have been used to scrub whatever pan they had emerged from. They weren’t, in fairness, representative of the restaurant’s other vegetables, like the assortment in a transcendently vapid risotto alla primavera, cooked to a state of depressing flaccidity. But while the veggies can be mush, the empire seems to be solid: bigger than ever and growing all the time. This past summer the family opened the restaurant Club 55, which joined its many other gilded dining establishments in Manhattan. Outside New York the Ciprianis have restaurants in London and Hong Kong, and they’re establishing resort hotels in Miami Beach and Beverly Hills. Of course it all goes back to the 1930’s and to Harry’s Bar in Venice, where the bellini and beef carpaccio were reputedly born. But on this side of the Atlantic, the progenitor and lodestar is the Fifth Avenue clubhouse, which opened in 1985 and was last reviewed in The Times in 1991, when Bryan Miller raised it to two stars from one. It’s a different restaurant now, literally. In June 2005 it closed for renovations, and when it reopened last May, the visible changes included more than fresh coats of lacquer on the lustrous wood-paneled walls. The bar had been moved to the northern side of the restaurant, a rearrangement that helped make way for about 30 additional seats. The hosts can now cram about 130 people in. And cram they do. At times they place the Frisbee-size tables for four so tightly together that Harry Cipriani seems to be doing an haute impersonation of Prune or the Spotted Pig. It’s a bizarre mix of indulgence and deprivation, the crisp white jackets on the servers communicating an ostentation that’s contradicted by plenty else, including the brusque manner in which those servers sometimes hustle diners through a meal. Even in an enclave this expensive, there are things seemingly done on the cheap. I can’t think of a credible motive other than cost saving for serving an appetizer of turkey tonnato in place of veal tonnato. That’s for $27.95. Although steak Rossini typically involves foie gras, what Harry Cipriani puts on top of a gigantic (and, it should be noted, juicy) filet mignon are chicken livers, chalky when I had them. That’s for $55.95. Among the scores of straightforward dishes, some had appeal. Calf’s liver was flavorful, veal sweetbreads tender and roasted branzino moist. I liked the oil-glossed octopus carpaccio, and cakes were dependably fluffy. But the kitchen’s blunders outnumbered its successes, which were modest in any case. The wan tomatoes beside buffalo milk mozzarella didn’t have a drop of sweetness. Main courses of lamb and salmon were overcooked, as were the meats in several pasta sauces, including an oily veal ragù over green tagliardi. Pasta sauces by and large were washouts, seldom registering much presence or any nuance. An amatriciana had no zest, no zip, and the meat in it looked and tasted not like guanciale or pancetta but like ordinary cubed ham. The selection of wines by the glass — a small carafe, really — is pathetic, and that fabled bellini is $19.95 for a restrained ration of white peach juice and prosecco. But the people-watching is nonpareil. You rarely see blondness this improbable, cosmetology this transparent, wealth this flamboyantly misspent. And while that isn’t cause enough to visit Harry Cipriani, it’s consolation if you must.”",0
Ninja New York,"“CONFUSING the point of a restaurant with the mission of a ""Saturday Night Live"" skit, Ninja New York deposits you in a kooky, dreary subterranean labyrinth that seems better suited to coal mining than to supping. You are greeted there by servers in black costumes who ceaselessly bow, regularly yelp and ever so occasionally tumble, and you are asked to choose between two routes to your table. The first is described by a ninja escort as simple and direct. The second is ""dark, dangerous and narrow,"" involving a long tunnel and a drawbridge that descends only when your escort intones a special command, which he later implores you to keep secret. I recommend a third path: right back out the door. Granted, you will be denied the sating of any curiosity about what a $3.5 million design budget permits in the way of faux stone walls, make-believe gorges and mock torches. You will forgo an iota of modest amusement. But you will be spared an infinitely larger measure of tedium, a visually histrionic smorgasbord of undistinguished food and a discordant bill that can easily exceed $100 a person with tax, tip and drinks. Ninja acts like a Disney ride -- Space Mountain under a hailstorm of run-of-the-mill or unappealing sushi -- but charges like Le Bernardin. It has a stringy crab dish served on a grapefruit that belches smoke, a ridiculous dessert in the shape of a frog and a whole lot of nerve. An American offshoot of a restaurant in Tokyo, Ninja intends to evoke a Japanese mountain village inhabited by ninjas, a special breed of stealthy warriors. In this case they come armed not only with swords and sorcery but also with recipes, which may be their most dangerous weapons of all. And they roam, romp and perform dopey magic tricks, including sleight of hand with rubber bands, over 6,000 square feet of darkened crannies and well-separated, quiet nooks. Each party of diners receives its own nook, which quickly takes on the aspect of a jail cell as the ninjas, delivering and removing dishes, laboriously slide the latticed doors open and closed, closed and open, ad infinitum. On my first visit, when I tried a $150 tasting menu with a dearth of culinary highlights but a surfeit of ninja pageantry, they reliably garnished this gesture with loud expectorations of a putative courtesy that sounded more like a rebuke, the phonetic rendering of which would be something along the lines of ""Go-mayn!"" ""Go-mayn!"" coughed a ninja, and onto the table dropped an appetizer of octopus drowned in vinegar. Not soon enough, it was spirited away (""Go-mayn!""), to be replaced and rivaled later on by a wedge of dry black cod in edible paper (""Go-mayn!""). I grew so weary of these syllables that I asked if they could be varied, if something along the lines of a ""Surrender, Dorothy!"" could be thrown into the mix. I was dead serious. The lineup of dishes isn't. Presented on a scroll, it mingles straightforward Japanese fare (tempura, sashimi, soba, yakitori) with flights of fancy that are grounded, but only somewhat, in Japanese and French traditions. In the name of ""new style sushi"" Ninja employs rice cakes as beds -- or sometimes graves -- for a rectangle of truffle-flecked omelet (it tasted like soggy French toast), a sliver of sautéed foie gras (pleasant, but how could it not be?) and a finger of seaweed-crowned mackerel (fishy in the extreme). It trots out a golden tower roll, which inexplicably embeds uni in spongecake, and a spring snow roll, which engulfs eel in an obliterating puck of sweetened cream cheese. In the service of table-side derring-do the restaurant spotlights what it calls a meteorite pot, a milky brew with Thai seasonings and slices of pork loin. A ninja cooks it in close, sizzling proximity to diners by heaving a large, hot rock into the broth. It's a soup and a sauna, not to mention a pointless effort for the thin, dull outcome. And in the interest of decadence Ninja concocts appetizers like a ""crème brûlée"" that combines egg custard with Parmesan, potato, foie gras and veal for a quichelike effect. It was actually good, a judgment that applied to only about a third of the food, much too small a fraction for a restaurant this expensive. The shoddy service also contradicted the cost. If a restaurant wants to promote six multicourse meals that range from $80 to $200, it should make sure that the menu on which these options appear doesn't have a big red food stain, as a companion's menu did. If a restaurant wants to charge between $12 and $18 a glass for white wine and $15 for weak specialty drinks, it should respond to an expressed interest in sake with a presentation of its sake list, not with the words ""I'll bring half a liter,"" which is what a ninja said. It should not run out of sparkling water, as it did one night. It should also advise its ninjas that it's not nice to brag about having entertained a Hollywood celebrity who, by the account of the ninja in question, was the apparent beneficiary of recent breast augmentation. I was happy for the disclosure and appalled at the indiscretion, as I was at so much else. A ""fatty tuna steak,"" available à la carte for $45, was no larger than a cutlet, and while I expected o-toro, I detected no toro. Once the bright red bits of shell that decorated a $40 lobster entrée were removed, all that remained was about eight bites of flesh, neither tender nor sweet. That frog dessert was just $10, but it was little more than a cloying blob of cunningly molded cream cheese. A ho-hum amalgam of chocolate cake, green tea cake and vanilla and green tea ice creams (also $10) was another triumph of shape over substance, resembling a bonsai. For a toddler with a trust fund and a yen for udon and maki, Ninja might be a valid alternative to the Jekyll and Hyde restaurant. For just about anybody else it's nonsensical, and its climactic illusion may well be a disappearing act.”",0
Bluebird London,"“Something seems to be going wrong at Bluebird London, the busily programmed 10,500-square-foot restaurant that the mall in the Time Warner Center imported from England in September. Maybe the people in charge have been taking management cues from Prime Minister Theresa May’s government, which has approached its Brexit plan like a class of first graders trying to build a working jet airplane out of Lego pieces and a flying-squirrel sock puppet. Or maybe the mess back home has just sapped the restaurant’s spirit. Whatever the cause, what was meant to be a cheerful gift from London has turned into the Bluebird of Unhappiness. Sir Terence Conran opened the original Bluebird in 1997 inside an Art Deco garage built on King’s Road in Chelsea for the Bluebird Motor Company. It was one of his “gastrodomes,” those soaring complexes like Quaglino’s and Bibendum that embedded restaurants within a busy hive of shops, cafes and bars. The gastrodomes’ designs were talked about more often and more enthusiastically than their menus, which aimed for unthreatening familiarity. The current owners, D & D London, have managed to keep the London Bluebird in circulation by changing upholstery and chefs, but it is not at all clear why they or the Time Warner Center believed that a Bluebird clone would play in Manhattan in 2018. True, the retail shop has been dropped. But up front, next to the desk where the hosts have mastered the art of checking reservations without making eye contact, is a cafe-slash-wine bar. A glass case there serves as a temporary prison for aging pastries and tragic snacks. Beyond is a lounge followed by a bar, the centerpiece of which is an enormous plexiglass sculpture of a ponytailed woman’s head that doubles as a shelf for weird liqueurs. Just before the ramp that descends to the main dining room is a console with two turntables which, a note on the website says menacingly, are operated on weekends by “live DJs.” At other times, the restaurant stages such events as a workshop in the art of making “a seriously chic wreath.” The poster-size menus drawn up by Nicolas Houlbert, the chef, cram so much copy onto a single page, and are organized so randomly, that they are best approached as if you were doing a word search, by unfocusing the eyes and waiting until the letters organize themselves into recognizable patterns. Look, here’s butternut squash soup. This must be fluke — no, fluke crudo. Long Island. Burrata. The 10,000-square-foot space includes a cafe, a bar, a lounge (pictured) and a dining room.Credit...Caitlin Ochs for The New York Times Long Island burrata? When you have finished the puzzle, please savor the warm feeling of accomplishment for a moment, because it goes away once the food arrives. The “crispy shrimp” have the limp, expired quality of tempura that’s been doing laps all night at a conveyor-belt sushi place. Yellowfin tuna poke has been tossed onto a big, damp heap of unseasoned quinoa, which must be there to soak up any seasoning that accidentally attaches itself to the fish. At lunch there is a lobster Cobb salad with lettuce and round, red objects that are probably supposed to be tomatoes. Because you are in an English restaurant, you will be curious about the English food. Because you are in Bluebird London, you will regret this. A prawn and monkfish curry is presented on a thali with mango chutney, basmati rice and paratha, which run the gamut from unnecessarily sweet to ridiculously sweet. The fish half of fish and chips is golden and crisp on the ends but pale and soggy in the middle. At least the minted peas that come with it are crunchy. This is more than can be said for the potato chips that come with an order of beef tartare. They are pale, cobweb-colored, not fresh, and undercooked so they sag and fall apart beneath any amount of beef. The tartare, by the way, is seasoned with ketchup, which is not as wrong as you might think. If something comes with a pastry crust, exercise caution. On top of an allegedly Cornish chicken pie, sealing in dry chicken and mushrooms coated in grease that is trying its best to be mistaken for sauce, is a dome of puff pastry; it doesn’t taste like butter or salt, but it is cooked. The thicker crust around a farmhouse pork terrine, served with a chill that brought out its Spammy qualities, is on its way to being cooked. The very, very thick football of crust encasing beef Wellington is cooked only on the surface; deep inside, where it meets the tenderloin, is a mass of wet, gluey dough. This costs $95 and will serve two people, both of whom had better like the taste of raw flour. All is not doom and gloom in the pastry department, though. The pull-apart cheese straws are thick, puffy and warm, bronzed on top with baked Montgomery’s Cheddar. Most of the sweets are likable, particularly the cube of sticky toffee pudding and the wedge of Bakewell tart with a layer of orange marmalade between the frangipane and the pastry shell. The only real hazard on the dessert menu is the barely congealed Pimm’s jelly at which somebody has hurled fistfuls of chopped cucumbers and strawberries. It’s like a stray plate of salad that you might pick up at a party before you realized that somebody had dumped the warm dregs of a drink into it. The servers seemed eager to oblige, but gave the impression of struggling in the face of unseen enemies. One night, asked “Still or sparkling?,” I chose the sparkling water. My server began to walk away, then turned on his heel and said, “I’m sorry, we’re all out of sparkling.” “That’s fine,” I said. “I’ll just have the BrewDog I.P.A. instead.” “I apologize,” he said. “We don’t have any draft beer.” After the main course was cleared, I asked him for the Chocolate Bluebird. “That is our signature dessert,” he said. I nodded. I had read that this was a chocolate mousse inside a blue-chocolate shell in the shape of a vintage racecar once made by the Bluebird Motor Company. “Unfortunately, we do not have it tonight,” he said. His courtesy went a long way. Ultimately, though, I preferred the blunt approach that one of the bartenders took with one of my guests. Looking over the long list of old and new cocktails, she asked the bartender which he would recommend. “If you want to drink something that tastes good,” he said, “I wouldn’t order anything off our menu.”",0
Sugarfish by Sushi Nozawa,"“Like many habits, the pursuit of good sushi can get expensive. At the extreme end, the cost includes airfare to Tokyo and bribes to hotel concierges. Even for New Yorkers who stick close to home, the price of keeping up to date on sushi is high and climbing. Well-financed sushi nuts have already had the $145 omakase and been served on both sides of the counter by the profoundly courtly employees of Kosaka; tried Sushi Zo’s $200 omakase, the rice almost invisible under very long and very soft and unadorned ribbons of fish; sat down to Ichimura’s $300 sonata of fish cured and seasoned in an emphatic style that descends from the days before refrigeration; and handed over as much as $400 to Sushi Ginza Onodera for nigiri and other dishes that are as minutely detailed as the interior is soaringly grand. For sushi chasers whose bank accounts are not self-replenishing, this all gets kind of depressing. Or consider the novice fan, who has begun to realize that there are realms of pleasure out there beyond tuna rolls from Duane Reade. What’s next? Sugarfish by Sushi Nozawa would like to be the answer. It’s not, but enough people believe it is, or want to believe, that getting inside this four-month-old restaurant on East 20th Street can be a test of patience. Sugarfish arrived with an out-of-town pedigree. Its branches around Los Angeles have an ardent following, and one of the chain’s founders, Kazunori Nozawa, was among the first sushi chefs to bring to that city a rigorously autocratic style. Specializing in omakase, he was known to yell at those foolish enough to stir wasabi into their soy sauce. Nobody yelled at me at Sugarfish, but the staff didn’t seem all that eager to feed me, either. I made my first assault on the host stand just after 6:30 one weeknight. (The place doesn’t do reservations.) I was alone and willing to wait even if it took until closing time — 11 that night. What an optimist I was in those days. “We’re not taking any more names tonight,” a host announced. Later, I learned to stage my raids between 2 and 4 in the afternoon, not hours when I typically crave raw fish. One lucky day, I was in within 30 minutes and out before sunset. One can order sushi by the piece, but the servers and the printed menu heavily push the three “Trust Me” meals. This is a variant on omakase, which roughly means “I trust the chef,” but a Trust Me is not an omakase meal. It is, essentially, a set menu served in waves. All three start with chilled edamame and slices of tuna in ponzu, move on to several small courses of nigiri and end with a hand roll or two. The simplest, Trust Me Lite, is $27 and includes four pieces of nigiri; the most expensive is the Nozawa Trust Me, with 12 pieces of sushi and two hand rolls at a price of $51. Each course zooms out of a window in the kitchen where sushi is made with unusual speed. Efficiency lets Sugarfish keep prices low, the volume high and the rice warm — a hallmark of what the critic Jonathan Gold has termed the School of Nozawa. The rice is not only warm. It’s seasoned with so much vinegar that it’s almost pickled. This makes it appealingly energetic, a quality that sets it apart from the rest of the food. The fish is uniformly soft and pretty, but none of it tastes much like fish. Sweet shrimp and sea scallops were both exactly as they should be. But there was no heft to the tuna, no depth to the salmon, and anybody who happens to like shiny-skinned, fishy-tasting species like mackerel or sardines is in the wrong restaurant. The menu and website make much of Mr. Nozawa’s connections among elite fishmongers, but the selection at Sugarfish rarely rises above entry level. The menu lists certain specials “when available.” Sea urchin is one; the last time I went, there wasn’t any. This has to be the only sushi restaurant in New York that can’t get its hands on sea urchin. Fresh wasabi may be too much to ask at Sugarfish’s prices, but there is no wasabi at all under the fish. This is weird. Where sushi is concerned, wasabi isn’t just a condiment. It’s the air in the tires. Sugarfish lets you apply your own from some concentric bloops of stuff that tastes like watery horseradish and looks like a green version of the poop emoji, without the smile. By the end of my third meal, I was desperate for some break in the monotony. If Mr. Nozawa had suddenly materialized to yell at me, I would have given him flowers.”",0
Potluck Club,"“Potluck Club opened last summer on Chrystie Street on the Lower East Side — outside the old boundaries of Chinatown, in an area where younger Chinese businesses sidle up against tattoo parlors, oyster bars and candlelit cocktail lounges with disguised speakeasy entrances. It’s a perfect location for a neo-Cantonese restaurant that looks at Chinatown traditions from a slight distance, through the eyes of young people who grew up eating in and around the neighborhood but have spent most of their adult lives in other places. Given all the threats facing Chinatown, Potluck Club could have come across as sentimental or wistful, but it’s not. It offers a fresh, energetic look into Chinese culture, and has fun with it, too. It isn’t a great restaurant, but it knows how to have a good time. The atmosphere helps to put the idea across. The host stand is a green booth with a pagoda roof that looks like a ticket window out of the Sun Sing or the Music Palace, two long-gone Chinatown theaters where you used to be able to catch Shaw Brothers wuxia films. Just past that is a display of movie posters from the golden age of Hong Kong and Taiwanese cinema. A mural celebrates “Shaolin Popey,” the 1994 slapstick martial arts movie featuring two ass-kicking boy monks. Zhan Chen, the chef, and Peter Chen, his sous-chef, are brothers and Chinatown natives who cooked Mediterranean and Italian food before coming to Potluck Club. They fill their menu with classic Cantonese dishes like rice rolls and pot stickers, then bring in flavors from outside the neighborhood. On weekends, Potluck Club doesn’t serve dim sum. Instead it serves brunch, the most American meal of the week. You can get milk tea made with oat milk or an egg sandwich filled with bacon char siu. The restaurant keeps switching back and forth between cultures like this, a move that a lot of kids and grandkids of immigrants will recognize right away. The dish that best sums up Potluck Club may be a platter of fried chicken in a lacy, salt-and-pepper-style shell. It’s served with raised biscuits that might have been airlifted from a North Carolina dinner table, except that they’re flavored with scallions. A three-dimensional play on a scallion pancake, the biscuit can be split open, spread with sweet and smoky chile-plum jam, and dressed with a wheel or two of pickled jalapeño for a very entertaining chicken sandwich. When the biscuit’s gone, you’ll still have a few pieces of chicken and the jam to keep you company. Then again, the rice roll noodles with asparagus and oyster mushrooms may capture the restaurant’s spirit more succinctly. The dish is virtually a straight throwback to vegetable chow fun (or beef chow fun, if you have ordered it with hanger steak). In this version, though, the char from the wok is more emphatic than usual and the sauce contains a spoonful of chile paste, which a cook on Mott Street would probably leave out. Best of all are the noodles, fresh and tender and almost transparently thin; when you bite through one of the rolls, you can feel what seems like every single layer. The salt-and-pepper chicken should not be confused with the “crispy drunken chicken.” That one is marinated in Shaoxing wine and other flavorings. It isn’t bad, but tastes as if two or three recipes were locked inside it, each struggling for supremacy. Potluck Club’s version of that Chinese-banquet standby, fried shrimp with candied walnuts, improves on the original. The mayonnaise, usually just plopped on the platter as a dip, is seasoned with Calabrian chiles and brushed all over the tiger shrimp, which gain some fire and keep their crunch. In its homage to Chinatown’s vanishing traditions, both of living and cooking, Potluck Club resembles another fairly new local restaurant, Uncle Lou’s, on Mulberry Street. Uncle Lou’s tries to appeal to all generations; as the website says of its Cantonese dishes, “The ‘lo wah kiu favorites’ takes grandparents back to the Cantonese villages in Toisan, Sunwui, Enping, and Hoiping. ABC’s and ‘jook sing’ are comforted by classic meals they enjoyed between Chinese school and playing in Columbus Park.” Lo wah kiu are older Chinese immigrants who were born overseas, while ABC means American-born Chinese, and it’s the ABC sensibility that Potluck Club reflects. It’s a restaurant for younger diners who grew up going to weddings at Jing Fong and eating at Nom Wah before it was cool. The Chen brothers give them the food they remember from childhood, but they’re well aware that their customers’ palates have been shaped by everything that’s happened to Asian cooking in New York since Momofuku Noodle Bar; they use more salt and chiles, pay closer attention to meats and produce, and summon a greater intensity overall. Occasionally you may come across ingredients that should not have made the cut. The snow-pea stems in a stir-fry were a little tough and woody. The candied walnuts with the tiger shrimp were made from nuts that might have spent too long in storage. Such lapses are made up for by the sweet and fat-moistened Berkshire pork in the pot stickers and the deep, rolling seafood flavor that XO sauce gives to the fried rice. And there is the drinks menu, built for people who have moved decisively beyond Tsingtao. Potluck Club has located a green-peppercorn pilsner, Jade Scorpion, brewed in Hong Kong; a pale ale made from puffed rice by a craft brewer on the mainland; and a few other cans and bottles that will be new to many New Yorkers. More familiar, but still welcome, is the assortment of bottles from natural winemakers like Vinyes Tortuga in Catalonia and Meinklang in Austria. There is just one permanent dessert, a pineapple soft serve topped with two Chinatown signatures. First, there are crunchy, sugary bits from a crumbled pineapple bun. The other garnish is a fortune cookie. I’ve had the dessert twice, but I’ve never gotten a message I liked as much as the motto I once saw spelled out in black plastic letters in an illuminated movie marquee above the bar. It reads: “Here for a good time not a long time.””",1
Stretch Pizza,"“It is the age of the pizza geek. If you recently stood in line for a pizza, or used Resy Notify to get a table at which you later ate a pizza, or showed up at a certain place and time because you had learned on Instagram that it was going to be the site of a pizza drop, chances are that a pizza geek made the pizza in question. When pizza geeks are talking, no step in the process of mixing and rising and baking of pizza is too technical, no detail is too granular. They speak to one another about the hydration of their dough, the effect of long fermentation times, the digestibility of the crust. Which ought to mean that the time is right for a Wylie Dufresne pizzeria, such as Stretch Pizza, which he recently opened on Park Avenue South. No other chef did as much as Mr. Dufresne to make kitchen geekery cool. His restaurant wd-50 was the city’s foremost laboratory for pure and applied food science. He figured out how to use gelatin, gellan gum and an immersion blender to fry mayonnaise; how to bind ground shellfish with transglutaminase to make shrimp noodles; and how to exploit the reaction of xanthan gum and konjack flour to make a foie gras terrine that could be stretched and tied in a knot. To the extent that it had ever caught on, the practice of following scientific principles to achieve breakthroughs in the kitchen had largely faded from restaurant cooking by the time Mr. Dufresne closed wd-50, in 2014, and his more casual restaurant, Alder, in 2015. That approach is very much alive, though, in baking circles — especially, and somewhat improbably, among the younger generation of pizza makers. Even the mozzarella-paved road that led Mr. Dufresne to the pizza business — reading up on technique during the shelter-in-place phase of the pandemic, practicing at home, posting pictures of his pies on Instagram, and eventually selling them to takeout customers at a pop-up — is the same route taken by many of the newly minted pizza geeks. So why doesn’t more of the bug-eyed nerd energy that’s so abundant on the pizza scene these days make its way into Stretch Pizza? The pizzeria, which Mr. Dufresne owns in partnership with Gadi Peleg, the owner of Breads Bakery and a card-carrying dough geek himself, pays homage to the pizza Mr. Dufresne ate while growing up in Manhattan in the 1970s and ’80s. This was not the coal-oven pizza that people lined up to get from John’s and Arturo’s, but the portable, foldable slices sold on paper plates by Famous Ray’s Original in the Village and available in a reasonable facsimile in every part of the city. There’s no margherita or marinara on the menu at Stretch, which leads off with a “Classic NY” pie — what a New Yorker would call a cheese, or plain, or regular pizza. Mr. Dufresne has vastly improved the crust, bringing it into the modern era. It is much lighter and crisper and fresher-tasting than was usual in the ’80s, when pizza crust had no noticeable flavor except for an occasional sweetness from added sugar, and pizza shops never talked about their dough at all, let alone its digestibility. The era of tight trousers and unbuttoned shirts is also the touchstone for, among many others, Scarr’s Pizza and Paulie Gee’s Slice Shop. But their pizzas ooze more streetwise charm than Stretch’s — and more orange grease, for that matter. The 12-inch pies at Stretch are prim, almost chaste. Grease may not be everyone’s favorite pizza topping, but Stretch might be improved by using a little more of it. Most wood-fired pizzerias these days shower their pizza with extra-virgin olive oil before it goes into the oven; oil is a major component in the crackle on the crust of a Sicilian or grandma pizza. So is grated cheese, which is responsible for the Detroit-style “frico crust” that has spread far beyond Detroit in the past few years. All this has worked on New Yorkers’ palates, and now relatively low-fat pizzas like those at Stretch can strike us as lacking in flavor. Mr. Dufresne may see all this added oil and cheese as cheating, but Stretch could stand to bend the rules. In a sense, it does. The pizzas arrive with three dipping sauces: green goddess, tomato and halal-cart white sauce. But does great pizza need sauce on the side? Stretch makes two standard pies, plain and pepperoni. All the others are original. The most fun to eat is the Couch Potato, a reworking of a loaded baked potato. The most original may be the Nellie, a heart-on-the-sleeve love song to shallots, which appear roasted, pickled and fried into golden wisps that cling in a lacy cloud above the surface. There is very little of the boundary-pushing that Mr. Dufresne is known for, although the puddles of horseradish cream between slices of ham on the Ploughman will not be up everyone’s alley, and topping a zucchini and smoked eggplant pizza (the Oddfather) with “tempura crumbs” may not be functionally different from pouring a box of Rice Krispies over it. Appetizers suggest that Mr. Dufresne could run a smart, playful and truly inventive Italian restaurant in the manner of Don Angie and its imitators. Batons of chickpea fritters contain more fresh basil than you’d think was possible, and shrimp-scampi toasts seem to taste like Little Italy one minute and Chinatown the next. A tender meatball on a fluffy white bun turns out to be, essentially, a meatball parm hero that is almost ready to ascend to heaven. But nothing is as good or mind-bending as the potato chip salad. It sounds like a classic stoner idea, and for all I know it is one, but it takes an unusually bright stoner to think of dressing a green salad with salt-and-vinegar potato chips that work as both crouton and vinaigrette. This dish already has a cult following. Among the faithful there was minor panic last month when Grub Street reported that Rick Bishop, the Sullivan County farmer who makes the chips, had retired. A pizzeria is in trouble when its most talked-about item, and probably its most pleasurable, is a salad. This trouble can be eased by one of the superbly woven cocktails, like the vodka martini with tomato brandy and olive-leaf liqueur, called the Crossing Delancey. It can be soothed with banana soft serve that has been encased in a peanut butter shell and sprinkled with springy cubes of chocolate babka. But it can’t quite be erased.”",1
Jupiter,"“King isn’t a perfect restaurant, but it is a perfect example of a type of restaurant that many New Yorkers dream about. It’s that small, charming spot downtown where the details have all been thought about, though not so much that it becomes uncomfortable, and the menu is a likable quilt of flavors from Tuscany, Provence and other parts of Europe where humanities professors used to rent villas in the summer. Even mediocre restaurants on this model can be appealing. King is far from mediocre; it embraces the archetype and draws fresh pleasures from it. Late last year, the three women who own King opened a second restaurant, Jupiter. (There is a nice feminist joke in their swiping names from masculine power figures. Maybe they can call their next place Pope.) The focus this time is firmly on Italy, especially pasta. Jupiter is one giant leap from King’s little downtown space. A member of the platoon of younger, more idiosyncratic restaurants taking over Rockefeller Center, it inhabits a sprawling dogleg inside glass walls on the concourse level. The bar and one dining room recede away from the skating rink. Another room faces the rink head-on. A third seating area along a walkway in the concourse will open in March, a sidewalk cafe that happens to be underground. All told, there about 140 seats — green Gio Ponti chairs, yellow leather banquettes, gently curved bar seats that match the red-marble bar. Servers ricochet around in seersucker shirts that are color-coded by zone: blue stripes in the dining room, yellow behind the bar, green at the door. The colors stay separate and so, in some ways, do the different elements of the restaurant. While you can have a pleasant lunch or dinner, it’s harder to have a great one. I’m not even sure great meals are the point of Jupiter. You can get off to a brisk, Italianate start with one of the house aperitivos like the fizzy, vodka-based Callisto spritz, which pits bitter quinine and charred lemon peel against sweet quince purée. If you’re going straight to the harder stuff, let me direct you to Jupiter’s reworking of Ian Fleming’s Vesper, which adds a soft, almost tropical taste to the original by infusing vodka with roasted fig leaves. Either one should click with green and black olives, drenched in good oil and scented with bay leaves and ribbons of orange peel. This would also be a good time for a fried snack. Steer past the sullen artichokes alla giudia and call instead for a plate of fried zucchini sticks in puffy, golden husks of batter. They are very good and almost certainly a homage to the ones at the River Cafe in London, where two of Jupiter’s owners, the chefs Jess Shadbolt and Clare de Boer, were working when they met. Their executive chef, Gaz Herbert, has served time in its kitchen, too. The third owner, Annie Shi, has assembled a varied, idiosyncratic group of wines by the glass, all made in Italy. (Some bottles from France and California were allowed to slip into her full list.) With a glass of wine on the table, maybe the obscure Friulian white from Edi Kante called vitovska, you can zoom on to antipasti, a strong suit of Jupiter’s. Slices of cured meats are draped invitingly beside crisp and colorful giardiniera dusted with dried oregano. Under dark leaves of charred and wilted Treviso, a big creamy lump of mozzarella di bufala is served with warm chickpeas mashed with loads of olive oil; I’m not sure I understand the pairing, but I like it. And there’s nothing mysterious about the joy of spreading impeccable, lemon-dressed crab meat on rustic grilled bread with a smear of aioli. In the best starting dishes at Jupiter, ingredients that need very little help to begin with are given some unexpected turn — the oregano crumbled over the giardiniera is a great example — and, more often than not, showered with fresh and fragrant olive oil. The kitchen takes a similar tack with the housemade pasta, both fresh and dried. Often, though, the unexpected turn goes awry, and pastas that are probably supposed to be saucy come out soupy. How are you supposed to eat a nest of tajarin with whole chicken livers perched on top, like meatballs on spaghetti? Watery melted butter didn’t cling to the noodles, but instead pooled around the rim of the plate. Bottarga whipped with olive oil did the same thing with spaghetti given a last-minute application of grated bottarga. That dish later evolved into one with small clams steamed in white wine, but the sauce still didn’t act like a sauce. Alphabet soup in brodo — minus all the letters except the ones that spell out Jupiter — sounded comforting. But the broth was hard to taste under a hail of grated nutmeg. Some of the soupier pastas were better. Double-barreled curls of casarecce made a great bed for beef and onions braised in white wine, aromatic with juniper berries. And Jupiter has a fascinating, extremely rustic take on pizzoccheri de Valtellina, that fortifying amalgam of cabbage, potatoes, cheese and buckwheat noodles that helps Lombardy get through its cold mountain nights. Like some other dishes, it is unexpectedly oily, but the lid of toasted cheese on top is very hard to say no to. There is also a superb tomato sauce with tagliarini and squares of shaved ricotta salata. But there are too many ways to go wrong with pasta at Jupiter, and pasta is hard to avoid. Until recently there were only two main courses, a 32-ounce porterhouse alla Fiorentina and a whole grilled dorade, stuffed with rosemary and lemon and dressed with sizzled anchovy. It is very good, but like the steak it is meant to be shared. In the past few weeks, grilled sardines and veal Milanese were added to the menu. If you want to eat an appetizer, a pasta and a main dish, though, you will need strong eardrums. The dining rooms are loud at lunch; at night, they’re roaring. When dinner goes beyond 90 minutes, I want to run for the peace and quiet of the nearest subway track. Jupiter seems to be aiming for a cross between a serious trattoria and a casual pasta bar, but it is stuck somewhere in the middle. The prices reflect the quality of the ingredients but not the consistency of execution, and they’re in active conflict with the noise. Building a large, exciting restaurant in the twilight corridors of the Rockefeller Center concourse has to be a challenge. Anybody can show up at the host stand — NBC executives, Saks shoppers, King regulars, people on their way to see Big Thief at Radio City or “Leopoldstadt” at the Longacre. Jupiter probably hopes to appeal to all of them. This will make for fun people-watching, but it may also explain why the owners haven’t hit on an identity for Jupiter yet. Everybody knows what a charming Village restaurant looks like. But a charming pasta restaurant in the Rockefeller Center concourse? They’ll have to make it up as they go along.”",1
Lord's,"“Lord’s is the second restaurant the chef Ed Szymanski and his partner, Patricia Howard, have built together in Greenwich Village. The first, which put down roots in the first pandemic summer, is called Dame. With its echoes of British nobility, the naming scheme is a way of letting us know that the two restaurants are English in spirit without going all Charles and Camilla on us. They are also a his-and-hers matched set playing gender roles. Dame is a seafood place decorated in soft whites and unpainted wood, like a newly remodeled beach house rental on the North Fork. At Lord’s, on the other hand, the curtains, awning and walls are a serious shade of British racing green familiar from Jaguars made in the 1960s and ’70s. As for the menu, it is a festival of meat and offal in a modern British style that hasn’t been seen much in New York lately. I wasn’t wild about the whole meat-for-boys, fish-for-girls foolishness when Major Food Group did it at the Pool and the Grill. I don’t love it at Lord’s, either, although at least the restaurant doesn’t give us butched-up steakhouse service, the way the Grill does. And to be fair, a pescatarian could eat at Lord’s very happily. (Vegetarians, though, are out of luck unless they’re content with Welsh rarebit and a side of what the menu calls “proper English chips” — both very good, but not the stuff plant-based dreams are made of.) In a sense, Lord’s is the restaurant New York’s carnivores have been waiting for since Mr. Szymanski was the chef at Cherry Point, in Brooklyn. When I reviewed the place early in 2019, it was my hope that the rest of the city would have a chance to enjoy his pheasant-and-bacon pie, but Mr. Szymanski left not long after. The tavern did not survive the pandemic. Later that year, when new owners bought the White Horse Tavern, they hired Mr. Szymanski to overhaul the menu. It never happened. Next, Mr. Szymanski and Ms. Howard, already a couple, became business partners when they secured a snug little restaurant space on Macdougal Street. He was drafting a menu of animals grilled over wood from nose to tail, though not necessarily in that order, when Covid ambled in. The pandemic strategy they landed on was fish and chips, made with more than a bit of modern chef know-how but sold in paper boats through an open window. This succeeded so well that by the time they were ready to open a real restaurant, fish and chips had to be central to the business. So we got Dame and its seafood menu. We had to wait until October, when Lord’s opened, to see a Szymanski meat pie again. They are oval now, and a little bigger, large enough to satisfy most meat-pie appreciators. The suet crust is still tender and scored in a sunburst pattern. The fillings change daily. So far I’ve had a chicken-bacon pie seasoned with tarragon that was very good in a quiet, weeknight way, and a more attention-getting pie of long-stewed ox cheeks that carried a rousing, pungent undertone of Stilton. Most of the snacks are bits of English cookery that would have fit right in at Cherry Point. The Scotch egg is a beauty. Instead of standard-issue dry, peppery pork sausage, Lord’s molds spiced lamb kofta around the egg, bringing the dish back to its likely roots in India (no matter what its name says). Inside, the yolk is bright and shiny like warm marmalade. Welsh rarebit is a brick of assertively tart sourdough bread that seems to have absorbed its weight in sharp, mustard-scented Cheddar sauce. In homage to St. John in London, a bottle of Worcestershire sauce is presented ceremoniously and left beside the rarebit, an implicit invitation to go wild. A revision of oysters casino, oysters Kilpatrick are broiled under a square of crisp guanciale. This gets dressed with a sauce of shallots, brown butter and — happy and glorious, long to reign over us — a shot of Worcestershire. When you are ready for something a bit more substantial, you can eat a satiny braise of tripe and sweet onions with a trickle of Madeira; a fried pig’s head terrine and some deliciously crumbly black pudding together on the same plate; and two bundles of cabbage filled with sausage made from duck legs, livers, gizzards and whatnot, each with a brandied prune on top. Lord’s handles seafood deftly, which won’t surprise regulars at Dame. One of the most elegant dishes is a confident, understated pairing of smoked steelhead trout, buttery and soft, with a thick celery-root mousse. One of the most calming is the rolled omelet filled with lightly smoked eel and then broiled in Parmesan and béchamel. Poaching is not the usual method for cooking skate, but it is a good one, producing a firm, smooth flesh. Pink curls of potted shrimp tumble over the skate; it’s the kind of generous, seafood-on-seafood dish you see in New Orleans, but seasoned by a British hand, with seaweed in spaghetti-like strands on the side. I did wonder, though, who all that beurre blanc pooled around the skate was for. This question would come back in other forms as I ate my way through the menu. Maybe Mr. Szymanski is just trying to help us prepare for winter hibernation, but some of his sauces have been off-puttingly heavy. I hadn’t thought grilled mushrooms and stewed lentils could give off so much melted butter. Sweetbreads were sautéed to an irresistible bronze, but could have used a sauce that cut their richness rather than doubling down on it. Even when they’re not too rich, a fair number of dishes are excessive or unfocused; they slosh about more than they need to. Meat worship, whether as a menu theme or a life strategy, is best practiced with a sense of restraint. If you have somehow made it through the main courses without realizing that you are in an English restaurant, the desserts should set you straight. There is a Guinness sponge cake, airier than you’d expect, even after it’s buried under chocolate custard sauce and a spoonful of crème fraîche. The trifle is a frothy number, too — built up from poached apples, sponge cake, Calvados, vanilla custard sauce and soft whipped cream. And if you can see “Queen of Puddings” on the menu without hearing Mary Berry’s voice, I don’t know what is wrong with you. It is hard not to be curious about and even harder not to like. The Queen starts with bread crumbs and custard, then takes a thick layer of raspberry jam and, on top, onion-shaped like the domes on a Russian church, rows of small squishy meringues. They are as weightless and soft as marshmallows. Dessert at Lord’s may, in fact, be the lightest part of the meal.”",1
S & P Lunch,"“Eisenberg’s Sandwich Shop, a narrow, anachronistic lunch counter on lower Fifth Avenue, went up for sale several times over the years. Each time, its regulars reacted the way you would if an aged relative was rushed to the hospital. This was understandable. Eisenberg’s was getting up there in years. Under one name or another, it had been frying eggs and frothing egg creams on the same site, across from the Flatiron Building, since 1928. It appeared to have almost all its original parts, and they showed their age. There was a considerable chance that any new crisis at Eisenberg’s could be its last. A buyer always turned up just in time. Even so, the faithful worried. A new owner might change the menu, might clean up too much, might even kill the spirit of the place entirely — introducing a cocktail “program” with boozy egg creams; replacing the PB&J with razor clams; staying open at night, with votive candles flickering on the counter of green marble so dark it is almost black. Eisenberg’s was where New Yorkers went to get away from self-conscious restaurant mannerisms. The last thing anyone wanted was for the guy who had made your egg-salad sandwich to lean over and ask, “How are we enjoying the first few bites?” Ownership was transferred again recently and none of that came to pass, I’m happy to say, even though the premises apparently got a thorough tuneup. When the lights came on again in September, a new name was stenciled on the front window: S & P. A change of that magnitude could have caused a boycott among the faithful had it not turned out that S & P is what the place was called before it was Eisenberg’s. So welcome back, S & P Lunch. You look pretty good, considering. While certain New Yorkers recall Eisenberg’s as a perfectly preserved specimen of a classic luncheonette, in truth there were aspects of the place that did not bear close examination. The galley kitchen was so compact that there wasn’t room for all the food. This led to the practice, probably unique to Eisenberg’s, of keeping a stash of bacon, fried before the breakfast rush, in a cardboard box on the floor. The kitchen’s footprint appears larger by several square inches, with shelves to hold loaves of Pechter’s bread in wax-paper wrappers and single-serving boxes of cornflakes. The framed pictures of exquisitely obscure celebrities were packed off, along with most of the signs, like the one that read, “Welcome to the Hawaiian Room/ Your host/ Phil.” The tables along the right wall as you enter are also gone. This is where you will stand in line if there is a wait for seats in the back room, where a wall of banquettes has materialized, in jade-green vinyl. Very fancy. To atone for that addition, perhaps, the owners kept the ratty red vinyl on the stools at the counter. Some are held together with tape. They may be in worse shape than they were before, which would be a nice touch. None of these alterations hurt as much as the preservationists feared. In fact, S & P Lunch manages to feel almost exactly like Eisenberg’s while being different in almost every particular. The new owners, Eric Finkelstein and Matt Ross, seem to have understood that the Platonic ideal of the space transcends any individual item of décor. That ideal is unflashy, matter-of-fact and almost imperceptibly off-kilter, as epitomized by the modest new plaque in the window: “A Place to Eat Since 1928.” All but the most rabid fans would admit that the food in the old days was not uniformly high in quality. The usual survival tactic was to find a patch of solid ground on the menu and never budge from it. For me and many others, that meant either the tuna sandwich or the tuna melt. The tuna salad that formed the mortar of each was reassuringly creamy and smooth, with no hard bits of celery or any other surprises. And it is that way again. Is it also somehow a little richer, less powdery, with an extra zing of vinegar or lemon? I believe so, but as with many things about S & P, I can’t quite swear to it. I do know that the bread on the tuna melt — rye, of course — has improved by roughly 1,000 percent. I won’t go into what it was like before, but it now has body, flavor and a dark crust that really goes crunch when you bite down. Tuna salad is great on it. Pastrami — juicy, purplish, sliced fairly thick by hand and stacked just high enough to give the sandwich the profile of a suspension bridge — is fantastic. The S & P pastrami sandwich is better, though much smaller, than the famous one at Katz’s Delicatessen, which is not fantastic and never will be until something is done about the rye. The pastrami is not made in-house, or at the owners’ other businesses, the Hi-Hi Room and Court Street Grocers. It is purchased from a smokehouse in Rensselaer County and given a secondary rub with pepper and mustard, then an overnight steam. My worst fear for S & P was that a chef would take charge and proceed on the theory that you can never have too much umami, too much spice or too much smoke. I envisioned pastrami thickly crusted with peppercorns and smoked until it tasted like the brisket at Franklin Barbecue in Austin, Texas. Often, being bought by a chef is deadly for old diners, luncheonettes, clam shacks, soup counters and the like. These places ought to be somewhat interchangeable. This is the thing that S & P Lunch gets absolutely right. The chef the owners installed, Dan Ross-Leutwyler, seems to devote himself to making everything slightly better — and in some cases, more than slightly — without pushing the flavors to their limits or twisting things into creative new shapes. The corned beef hash is chopped and fried in-house, but if you weren’t paying attention you might not notice, and that’s fine. You could pick up and eat the cheeseburger (or either of two variations on it) with one hand, and by the time you’d started to wonder who baked the excellent little bun, the thing would be half gone. It’s reassuring to come across the split pea soup and realize it’s simply bad — bad in a normal way, not from trying too hard. The matzo ball soup is pleasant enough, but I don’t imagine many Jewish grandmothers will be asking for the recipe. The rugelach, though — soft and sticky with dried fruit and jam — will inspire envy. Meatloaf (smooth, sweetish and faintly orange with carrots) comes between two slices of white bread, with white onions and chili sauce. I could eat it once a week and I don’t especially care for meatloaf. Of the three or four dozen other things to eat at S & P Lunch, most are sandwiches. More are on the way, supposedly. The classic sandwiches on the menu look as simple and iconic as S & P itself. Any one of them could have served as a model for a Wayne Thiebaud painting. The salami sandwich is simply rye bread, deli mustard and a bulge of thinly sliced salami. The grilled cheese is made on excellent diner-style white bread griddled to the kind of even brown that some people spend fortunes trying to attain in a tanning booth. The original items on the menu are easy to spot because they have funny names and are more complicated. An eventful egg-and-cheese sandwich called the Lil’ Shonda incorporates a weighty slice of pastrami, pickled green tomatoes and something called Dinkee Sauce, which seems to be mostly mustard. It’s not that simple, inexpensive lunch places don’t exist anymore. They do, but they tend to be chains, and they almost never offer the particular urban experience that you can get at S & P. There and at a few other surviving relics, you can sit down and rub elbows with strangers, ask one of them to pass the ketchup. You’re somebody, because you’re at the counter, but you’re anonymous. You can join the conversation or eavesdrop, depending on your mood. You don’t get that at Sweetgreen.”",1
Javelina,"“I like Texans. I love their food and their music and their boots. I admire their ability to tame landscapes that are hostile to human life. I respect how quick they are to stick up for their state and its culture. In fact, I may be slightly afraid of Texans. I have no desire to mess with them. I can read the bumper stickers. Reviewing Javelina, which bills itself as “New York’s first authentic Tex-Mex restaurant,” may have presented me with an unusual conflict of interest. My interest in telling the truth about this establishment could come into conflict with my interest in not having my butt kicked by angry Texans. What if something I didn’t like at Javelina turned out to be the very thing that Texans most love about authentic Tex-Mex? It may get in the way of my earnest desire for my next trip to Texas to be a safe and peaceful one. Lucky for me, I have only good things to say about Javelina. Javelina, near Union Square, is a godsend for anybody who loves to eat before 6 p.m. or after 9:30 p.m.; since opening two months ago, the restaurant has been talked up so much in the press that those are usually the only reservation times available, even if you book a week or two ahead. You may worry that at those hours the dining room would be depressingly quiet, but that’s not the case. Javelina’s 58 seats always seem to be taken by large groups of people shouting with youthful animation. It always sounds as if somebody were telling a woman at the far end of the table that he had just found $1,000 under the menu, and the woman were shouting back that Ryan Gosling had just texted and he’s coming to the restaurant in, like, five minutes! How anybody gets drunk enough to act this way is one of several fun Javelina mysteries to keep you entertained. Fresh or frozen, the margaritas have a slight chemical taste that I was thankful for because it tended to keep my own alcohol intake to near-Mormon levels. I also stayed alert and sober when faced with the Tijuana Manhattan, made with tequila in the place of whiskey and served in a rocks glass with no ice at all, even though it was the temperature of a freshly killed snake. While bartenders elsewhere have become insufferable bores on the subjects of ice and proper shaking techniques, the ones at Javelina are refreshingly free of such pretension. Even the water is sometimes served at room temperature. The queso sampler at Javelina.Credit...Liz Barclay for The New York Times One night, the bar made me a Paloma in a pint glass, while a woman at my table got her Paloma in a much smaller glass. Everybody knows women drink less than men, so we appreciated the thoughtfulness. To avoid making her self-conscious, I suppose, the restaurant even charged us both the same amount, $13. At most restaurants, you are served what you ask for so routinely that your eyes glaze over with boredom. Javelina does not fall into the trap of dull predictability. One night after I left, I realized the guacamole I’d ordered had never arrived; it’s not every restaurant that gives you something to think about on your way home. Meanwhile, people at the next table were presented with a dish they insisted they hadn’t asked for. “You didn’t order brisket?” the server asked, keeping up the playful spirit. One of Javelina’s calling cards, queso, is usually suggested by the servers when taking orders. Occasionally this Tex-Mex cheese fondue is served hot, but more often it arrives lukewarm, which prevents trips to the emergency room. The cooler temperature offers the added benefit of allowing a latex-like film to congeal on top, which provides an interesting contrast in texture with the liquefied cheese below. Queso is short for chile con queso, so named for the hot peppers that are stirred into the melted cheese. Javelina’s traditional yellow queso is supposed to be flavored with serranos, while a white version is said to come with both jalapeños and roasted poblanos. But spicy food can be hard for many people to digest, so I am relieved to report that both colors are quite bland. A premium queso called the Bob Armstrong does have some flavor: It tastes like ground beef, which in fact it contains, along with guacamole and chopped tomatoes. The menu said that another loaded queso, the Mag Mud, was supplemented with black beans. I didn’t see them, so I probed the cheese with tortilla chips, digging way down to the bottom. Black beans shouldn’t be easy to lose in a bowl of white cheese. Where were they? About five minutes later, a server placed a bowl of beans on the table. “This is supposed to go with the queso,” he said. Mystery solved! The chef is Richard Caruso, and his menu looks unmanageably long, but fortunately only a few items on it are worth getting. Puffy tacos, a San Antonio specialty, come out well, with bits of pork shoulder and other taco toppings piled into a deep-fried corn tortilla, crisp outside and soft in the middle. The steak enchiladas are good, too, with a mouthwatering sour-cream sauce all around them. The cilantro-cream gravy around mahi-mahi is comfortingly thick and rich, and the fajitas are just what you’d expect them to be, with one difference: The flour tortillas are outstanding. Every time I went to Javelina, in fact, those flour tortillas were the best thing on the table. Tender, yielding, pressed in the kitchen and freshly browned on a comal, they are both thicker and lighter than the kind most places use as packing tape to seal up burritos. They are so good that if you happen to accidentally order the tacos filled with pale, cold brisket that tastes more like boiled pork than beef, you can simply tear off chunks of the tortilla and eat them on their own. Corn tortillas are used in the enchiladas de Tejas, and they really made me appreciate how good the other tortillas are, because these are as stiff as a new pair of jeans. They were filled with equally sturdy melted cheese and blanketed with a chile sauce that would make a wonderful way for Mexican cooking teachers to show students what happens when you try to toast dried chiles and end up burning them instead. There is no dessert menu, so every table is supposed to get a plate of sopaipillas, on the house. I got mine once out of three visits, just the right ratio to bring a tremor of anticipation to the end of the meal. The best news of all, for anybody who hates waiting around to settle the tab: There is no need to ask for the check. It is dropped without warning as soon as the last dirty plate has been cleared, and sometimes even earlier.”",0
The Bistro at Villard Michel Richard,"“The first time I ate at Villard Michel Richard, the latest restaurant to dance among the frescoes and marble pilasters of the Villard mansion in Midtown, I strongly suspected that I was in an awful hotel restaurant. This seemed like a connect-the-dots conclusion. It’s a restaurant. It’s in a hotel, the New York Palace. And it was awful. That didn’t make any sense, though. Born in Brittany but a star in the United States, trained in pastry but adept in every corner of the kitchen, Michel Richard has been one of the most respected chefs in this country since the 1980s. Settling in Washington, he gave the city a restaurant, Citronelle, that earned national fame. Michel Richard was serious. He would not have come to New York last fall to open an awful hotel restaurant. Other possibilities had to be considered. Hoping that I was wrong about the awfulness, I went back two more times, concentrating on the à la carte menu served in the bistro on the Madison Avenue side of the restaurant rather than the tastings presented in a room named the Gallery, where dinner starts at $140 for four courses. The Stanford White interiors look better than they have in years, thanks to the attention the design firm Jeffrey Beers International paid to the way light strikes the paintings and fireplaces. White’s giddily opulent Gilded Age rooms can awe out-of-town visitors. Two weeks before Christmas, the restaurant was full of little girls in fancy dresses, most of whom stared, hypnotized, into phones and tablets, although one young rebel held a doll in her lap. A glass cube in the center of the dining room shows off the wine stockpile amassed by Gilt, the last restaurant in this space. It’s not too hard to get a wonderful and affordable bottle, but you may have to manage on your own. One night, when my table of three wanted a little Beaujolais, the sommelier tried to sell us a magnum. Another time, when I asked for help choosing among more than 80 German whites, a manager said apologetically that he didn’t know much about them, and that the people who did weren’t around. Still, I always ended up drinking well. And if everything had been on the level of the roasted chicken, the rustic bean soup and the salmon fillet on a bed of lentils energized with balsamic vinegar, Villard Michel Richard would easily qualify as an average hotel restaurant. But many other dishes vaulted across the gap that separates average from awful. Think of everything that’s great about fried chicken. Now take it all away. In its place, right between dried-out strands of gray meat and a shell of fried bread crumbs, imagine a gummy white paste about a quarter-inch deep. This unidentifiable paste coats your mouth until you can’t perceive textures or flavors. It is like edible Novocain. What Villard Michel Richard’s $28 fried chicken does to Southern cooking, its $40 veal cheek blanquette does to French. A classic blanquette is a gentle, reassuring white stew of sublimely tender veal. In this version, the veal cheeks had the dense, rubbery consistency of overcooked liver. Slithering around the meat was a terrifying sauce the color of jarred turkey gravy mixed with cigar ashes. If soldiers had killed Escoffier’s family in front of him and then forced him to make dinner, this is what he would have cooked. Yes, Villard Michel Richard is, in fact, an awful hotel restaurant. But it still didn’t make any sense. Was Mr. Richard not the chef I had thought? Were the ecstatic reviews, the five awards from the James Beard Foundation, the induction into the Maîtres Cuisiniers de France, all a mass delusion? I doubted that, but to make sure I had dinner at Central Michel Richard, a bright, loud French-American bistro that opened in Washington in 2007. (Citronelle has been closed since 2012.) If a dish was served in both cities, I ordered it. In every case, the Washington version looked and tasted better, for the same price or less. Mr. Richard makes a chicken-liver mousse he calls faux gras, and at Central it was so silky and rich that the pun was not much of a stretch. The one in New York wouldn’t be mistaken for anything but mediocre chicken liver. Lobster bisque in Washington had a robust shellfish intensity. The Villard version was floury, pale and almost completely bland; you could get nearly as much flavor by putting a lobster bib into a juicer. A frisée salad at Central was garnished with crunchy little croutons, freshly crisped bacon matchsticks and a warm poached egg. At Villard, the croutons were stale, the bacon limp and the egg cold. The strangest thing about my dinner at Central was the fried chicken. It looked like the one at Villard, but it was terrific. The difference between them was like the difference between winning a medal for figure skating and falling through the ice. Mr. Richard was so clearly a smart, accomplished chef that for one crazy moment, I wondered if Villard Michel Richard was bad on purpose. Maybe he was paying tribute to the awful hotel food of years past, the way Grant Achatz and Dave Beran of the restaurant Next are paying homage to Chicago’s steakhouse tradition. The seafood pasta, after all, is almost a direct quote from the 1980s, when doughy, gluey, overcooked fresh pasta and washed-out bits of unidentifiable seafood drooped in flavorless pink sauces. Of the same vintage, and just as bizarre, were the mushrooms under a tower of puff pastry ringed with cold, mud-colored sauce that tasted of uncooked wine. (If Villard Michel Richard doesn’t make it as a restaurant, it could reopen as the Museum of Unappetizing Brown Sauces.) The flaw with this hypothesis was the desserts. They broke character. Mr. Richard’s elegant, reverse-engineered Kit Kat bar; his rectangle of classic crème brûlée with mango sauce; his profiteroles in the style of a croquembouche, with a steeple of puff pastry spheres enclosing the ice cream and a pitcher of warm chocolate sauce to be poured over the top: They were all too good to be a joke. The girls in dresses even put down their phones for the celebration cake, a chocolate drum that shoots out sparks and, when you break it open, reveals a jumble of fruit and spongecake. There was another possibility: Perhaps the restaurant was awful because Mr. Richard wasn’t actually involved. It’s true that he is not the owner, but neither does he have the kind of licensing and consulting deal that has often made the names of Gordon Ramsay or Todd English little more than celebrity endorsements. He is a partner, a publicist said, sharing in profits and overseeing “day-to-day operations.” A union contract limits his ability to hire and fire cooks, but that didn’t keep Paul Liebrandt and Justin Bogle from pulling off formidable technical feats when they ruled this kitchen. There is one more theory. Villard Michel Richard may be a symptom of the deal-making culture that afflicts the restaurant business. Too many chefs are being tempted with too many offers from too many developers and investors. Hotels especially know that a famous name lures travelers, who won’t realize until it’s too late that the food being served has nothing in common with the cooking that made the name famous. Opening a restaurant used to be a brutal process, and for many chefs it still is. If you’ve spent your own money and borrowed from your friends and family, you’re too scared to slack off. But the best-known chefs don’t have to worry about this anymore. It’s become much easier for them to open restaurants. Maybe it’s too easy, because running one is still as hard as ever.”",0
Nicoletta,"“IN an earlier, more primitive era, chefs with an entrepreneurial urge believed that success began with a delicious product. If you cooked something that enough people wanted to eat, you could build an empire that might one day span the country. First, though, you needed 11 secret herbs and spices. You needed special sauce. You needed Hot Doughnuts Now. It all sounds rather quaint. Thanks to the rise of celebrity chefs, restaurant empires have as much need for a great product as they do for spittoons and a separate ladies’ entrance. To see this new model in action, you need only study Nicoletta, the pizzeria opened in the East Village in June by the chef Michael White and his business partner, Ahmass Fakahany. It was already clear in March that Nicoletta was to be the first of several places rolled out from the same batch of dough. “We are developing distinct brands where we can open multiple restaurants, lowering costs as we go,” Mr. Fakahany told a reporter at the time as he explained how practices from his former career as a high-flying executive at Merrill Lynch were helping him wring extra profit from his restaurants. Nicoletta had been in the works for some time. In December, the two had filed a liquor license application for a corporation known as “Letta # 1 LLC,” a name that had been registered with the State of New York six months earlier. Marble tables were designed and fabricated, each with a spring-loaded socket in its top. The sockets can anchor pedestals that hold the pizzas several inches off the table. As for the product on the pedestal, apparently that could wait. About a week before the opening, by some reports, Mr. White was changing his pizza dough recipe almost day by day. He was talking about 12- and 16-inch pies cut in squares, in the style of his home state, Wisconsin. By the time hosts in Nicoletta T-shirts were stationed out on the sidewalk with clipboards to manage the people willing to wait 90 minutes or more for a table, pies were being cut into the usual wedges, and the 16-inch pizza was history. As it turns out, even the smaller size may be too much. The servers will tell you that it feeds two people. That may be true if both people are running a marathon the next morning. I was never able to finish one, even with two or three hungry assistants at the table. Some of this is because of sheer mass. Nicoletta’s pizzas are not quite deep dish, but they are heading in that direction. The crust is as strong as epoxy, and Mr. White piles it up with an abundance of toppings that would buckle an ordinary pie. In thickness and heft, a Nicoletta pizza resembles the September issue of Vogue. There was another reason my table never finished an entire pizza: we lost interest. The style of pizza Mr. White is pursuing emphasizes gut-stretching abundance over flavor. The pies are overburdened conglomerations of cheese, flour and fistfuls of other stuff; in the end, the elements cancel one another out. In the Fior di Zucca, zucchini blossoms and watery shredded zucchini were completely engulfed by an ankle-deep carpet of melted mozzarella. It was a vegetable pizza for people who hate vegetables. Not that the addition of undercooked Nueske’s bacon brought much relief to the bleak expanse of starch created by the layer of smashed potatoes on top of the Patatona. Other combinations were more promising, like the Calabrese, with excellent fennel sausage and curly divots of spicy pepperoni, or the Carbonara, the pasta classic reimagined in pizza form. But that great shelf of crust deadens the taste of any ingredient that gets near it. Mr. White has said he engineered the dough to stand up to the rigors of delivery and reheating with no loss of quality. In that, at least, he has succeeded. Warmed up a day or two later, a Nicoletta crust is just as stiff and bland as when it was fresh from the oven. Pizza hunters with long memories will recall another pizzeria founded by an acclaimed chef whose pizza was met, at first, with skepticism. A decade ago, Mario Batali’s Otto opened with pizzas that were griddled, not baked. At first, they were not encouraging. The dough was tweaked and tweaked again, but in the meantime you could have a wonderful time at Otto without eating a single slice. The menu offered many other diversions, including full-flavored vegetables, robust pastas, a wine list built for Italy-hopping, and Meredith Kurtzman’s array of gelati, which won cult status and deserved it. Nicoletta has a far less elaborate gelato menu than Otto’s. There is only one flavor, a house-made vanilla soft serve called fior di latte, but it was consistently the high point of my meals. Creamy and easygoing, it never failed to make me smile, whether topped with amarena cherries, drizzled with blueberry limoncello or left undecorated. Nicoletta would be a pleasant place to stop for ice cream if only the staff didn’t seem to expect you to order some of the other food first. But they do, and it’s not an uplifting experience, even if you steady yourself with a glass of red wine poured too cold from a tap. The pizzas, at least, don’t resemble anything else in New York. The salad recipes might have been nabbed from that corner trattoria you stopped going to a few years ago. There is the Nicoletta, with lettuce, red endive and a sliver of focaccia smeared with goat cheese. Or the insalata mare with clams, mussels, squid and octopus, all as tender as an extension cord, all bathed in a dressing that had no effect on any of it. The snacks and appetizers can have an off-the-rack quality as well. Tender as the meatballs were, is the city really suffering from a shortage? Nice surprises did pop up now and again, like the suppli fortified with ragù and the cucumbers pickled in white balsamic vinegar that were good enough to sell by the jar. But on the whole, what is striking about Nicoletta is how little evidence it gives of Mr. White’s prodigious talent for cooking Italian food that can make you dizzy with pleasure. He has overseen five restaurants that were awarded three stars in The New York Times: Fiamma, Alto, Convivio, Marea and Ai Fiori. (The last two are still open.) After a run like that, it must have been tempting to think that great pizza would materialize on command. So far, it hasn’t worked out that way.”",0
Lavo,"“THE imaginary mailbag this week spilled forth an imaginary request from an imaginary jock. I endeavored to answer him. Q. I need you to recommend a restaurant. I’m a 35-year-old professional in Manhattan, and I am looking for a place where I can take my boys from the office to meet this smoking-hot girl I hooked up with at Lily Pond in the Hamptons this summer. Me and my team, we’re big into that whole meatpacking district thing. We like steak, veal. Maybe Italian food? There’s one dude from Mexico City who eats only fish, which is weird. Maybe this girl would eat fish, too. I don’t know. We’ve been to something like 10 restaurants now, and I think her favorite foods are truffle fries and ketchup. But she drinks Champagne. So maybe bottle service? Speaking of, this place has to be exclusive. I need a little exclusivity to offset the fact that I’m taking a girl to dinner with six dudes who do math for a living, and not six girls who look just like her. Usually, she likes to eat in a room with women who look like beautiful giraffes and dudes tall enough to look down on them. Which is, by the way, a message I totally endorse: I’m a former rugby back, 6-foot-3, 220! Finally, if there’s a guy in the restroom who could hand me a towel after I’m done doing my business in there and washing my hands, maybe give me a mint or something? I would be into that. Old school! I would tip that guy $5 just for being there, you know? A. Broheim, let me set you up! Lavo is a large and almost luxurious new restaurant on East 58th Street, set above a nightclub, also called Lavo. It sits across the street from another nightclub owned by the same consortium, Tao. (You know Tao, Buddhaman. It’s where Kim Kardashian had her 30th birthday party.) The menu is Italian by way of a steakhouse, and if the food isn’t totally awesome, the portions are huge. You’ll love it. Lavo opened in September. The socialites and reality television personalities Tinsley Mortimer and Kelly Bensimon were both there on the first night and apparently put some kind of spell on the place, because roughly 70 percent of the women who eat at the restaurant look like one or the other of them. (An exception was the middle-aged woman in a teenager’s dress who smacked her older companion in the face the other night in the front dining room. She looked like Charo’s angry little sister and was immediately taken out to the street by two men in black suits.) There is a bar in the front of the place that moves from empty to packed at 5:30 p.m. and stays that way until very late in the evening. It serves as a holding station for people waiting for their parties to assemble: men in suits who’ve removed their ties, guys who worked in Brussels and don’t wear ties under their suits but sweaters, or little scarves. There isn’t a soft surface in the place, and the noise is cacophonous: it’s all raging id up there, a bull market in confidence, everyone waiting for the women to show. Beyond the bar, the room opens up beautifully, in debt to Keith McNally and his vision of what dining rooms in New York City ought to look like (imaginary Europe, with soft light and subway tile and old mirrors). There are tables everywhere, jammed one on top of each other as if to illustrate the concept of 110 percent, with a surprisingly high server-to-patron ratio. Which means you’ll rarely have trouble getting another $19 glass of Veuve. But it can be tough making your way through the room if you want to go to the restroom and dance with the man on the taps with the towels and mints. (Tell your lady friend not to forget her purse when she heads back there — she’ll need tip money for the matron handing out Now and Laters in that restroom, too.) The menus open up to almost the width of the table. You’ll want to get rid of these as soon as you can, if only to make room for wine. Here’s a cheat sheet: No one’s eating baked clams in this scene, but they’re the best appetizer, and you should stand strong for them. Fat littlenecks drenched in butter and garlic, they sit beneath bread crumbs funky with oregano. There is good sliced prosciutto as well, 18-month stuff out of San Daniele, served with a strange cornucopia of fruits and vegetables. Salads: huge. The mixed greens are the size of a throw pillow and come with pears and a gallon of sherry vinaigrette; the heirloom tomatoes with mozzarella comes with a full head of really cold cheese, like a softball on a plate. (Once there was burrata as a special: $32, and served just as cold.) There is even a retro number, with roasted beets with goat cheese and a sun-dried tomato vinaigrette. These are cold, too. Everything at Lavo that is served cold is served really cold — fridge cold. You want a meatball? You don’t, but they sell it as a signature item here, Lavo’s version of Nobu’s miso-marinated cod (not really!), a pound of Kobe rolled up into a too-salty ragu, or served with whipped ricotta or a salad. Better to order one of the oblong pizzas, which have a decent crust and which everyone at the table will eat. The lobster one, which unaccountably also arrives with roasted fingerling potatoes, is really not bad. Neither are the steaks: aged prime beef, grilled on the bone, with a wide selection of classic sauces and infused butters. Even if the evening falls apart, you won’t regret a beefy ribeye with green peppercorn sauce, served beside a cone of russet fries and a plate of sweetly bitter broccoli rabe. This is an expense-account meal, right? All in that will run a player more than $60. Other stocks rated buy include: The crisp chicken Dominic, with its dressing of white balsamic and chili flakes, and a wide footprint of veal parmigiano in a spicy marinara sauce. Avoid the rest, especially the gummy pastas, the shirt-cardboard veal Milanese. A roasted Chilean sea bass looks great going by under its sheen of sweet butter, alongside some tomatoes and a roasted portobello, and tastes good besides. But while I hate to say it, especially to you, we just can’t be eating those fish any more. Among other things, Jeremy Piven, they’re too high in mercury. Desserts, however, are designed with parties exactly like yours in mind. There are the standard gelati and tiramisu, just like a real Italian restaurant, a panna cotta cheesecake, like that. Most groups seem to order a huge Lavo log: an elegant Ho Ho, basically, with a toasted marshmallow sauce. It’s big enough to serve your table. They ought to be spinning music downstairs by now. Take your girl down and get some vodka on. Your boys as well. Courtney Love made an appearance last week. Cougar town!”",0
Nello,"“NELLO BALAN was standing on Madison Avenue in front of his restaurant, smoking a cigar. It was after 10 on a Tuesday night, and the dining room was empty save for a table of four people finishing a collection of wan Italian food that, with a few glasses of wine, would cost them $593.37 before tip. Diner food at Champagne prices, one said. Though much of his senior staff wears suits, and many of his customers dress in luxe outfits from the upscale boutiques nearby, Mr. Balan was wearing jeans and an untucked shirt. His bleached blond hair was cut close and his expression was fierce, almost predatory. Mr. Balan stood amid sidewalk planters of yellow flowers. These bring great cheer to the restaurant and to those passing by, as well. Flowers go far in explaining the appeal of Nello. Mr. Balan spat on the sidewalk and returned to the dining room, trailing smoke. He has claimed over the years to be a direct descendant of Vlad the Impaler. It seems entirely possible. Nello, which opened in 1992, is an ecosystem that is almost incomprehensible to those not a part of it. The food is not very good. Yet the restaurant’s customer base is built of the richest and most coddled people in the city, who love it for its elegance and, perhaps, simplicity. It is a private club of sorts, where the dues are paid nightly. The meetings are unadvertised. Nello’s dining room can be crowded at 3 p.m. or midnight. It can also be empty at 1 p.m. or 9 p.m. Regular patrons respond to whistles mere customers cannot hear. The table of four that night was made up of that latter group: New Yorkers relatively new to the restaurant, unknown to the management. They ate crisp artichokes offered as carciofi alla giudia. These tasted of shirt cardboard. They ate sawdusty chicken livers lashed with balsamic. They sipped at lentil soup familiar to anyone who owns a can opener and shared too-salty saffron risotto, correctly yellow, of no particular flavor. They gummed at cannelloni with mushrooms that from the grit on them might actually have been harvested wild, as well as at rubbery swordfish drenched in mustard sauce, then laughed about lobster ravioli so tasteless it might have been prop food for an advertisement. Only an arugula salad with fontina and pears could have been mistaken for something good to eat. But for all that? There were more flowers inside the restaurant, sitting in vases on the linen tablecloths of every table, fragrant and beautifully arranged. The city looked fantastic beyond them, through the front window, which during the summer is mostly open to the street. It was, despite all, extremely pleasant in Nello that night. There were waiters and captains and busboys and runners standing at the ready, servants at an 18th-century court. They sprang into action at the merest gesture, smiles blazing, and soon returned with whatever the table needed: another bottle of water, say, or a glass of middling Sancerre, a gin martini. This began to add up. That water was $12; the glass of wine, $17; the martini, $22. The restaurant’s best dish by far is tagliolini with butter, truffle oil, shards of black truffle and Parmesan. It costs $100. If that is no matter, the pasta is extremely buttery and delicious. Eat it and discover that Nello can be a fair place to have dinner. The theater of the place is, in any event, magnificent. It is Stephen Sondheim’s city of strangers played for sociology and laughs: a middle-aged woman in hot-pink fur and very high heels almost wiping out at the stairway that leads from the dining room down to the bathroom. “Champagne,” she giggled in explanation, and tottered away. During the day, the crowd is women who shop and women who dress like their daughters and men who meet them for lunch. There are air kisses and the tinkle of tennis bracelets against wine glasses. The kitchen trades mostly in salad, wine and the occasional pasta or veal. (The menu is the same as at night.) If you desire more than a lemon-scented salad and don’t want to spare the $100 for the pasta with truffles, the best bet is a simple bowl of green and white tagliatelle served with prosciutto, green peas, Parmesan and pecorino. Not bad, if very rich. (And $38!) This is food for children raised in boarding schools. Vitello tonnato, meanwhile, looks good enough straight from the kitchen. It tastes like sliced shoe, though, against a tuna sauce that carries a Miracle Whip tang. It’s grim, especially at $32. Rage can overtake a person at Nello: the place is what used to be called a rip. (And the desserts are stale to boot.) But if $32 means nothing to you, if it is the equivalent of the dollar the rest of us can spend on a slice of pizza off Times Square, the restaurant is welcoming and the people-watching is nonpareil. There is nothing snobby about it at all, least of all the food. One night at dinner, there was a very tall woman in elegant clothes, with skin stretched tight over her face in unnatural ways and glasses the size of salad plates to magnify that. She was eating with a small red-faced fellow with dark hair in a center part, who was wearing an ascot and green Tyrolean coat. A cartoonist might render them as an awkward French giraffe and a mischievous Austrian chimp. The woman drank wine as the man devoured a plate of pasta in tomato sauce. (Decent, and, at $29, maybe a bargain.) They were a good couple. When he finished, she wiped at the corner of his mouth with a napkin. The man signaled to a waiter. He laughed and slapped the table with his open palm. “AAAH-gain!” he cried, happily. “Once AAAH-gain!” The waiter smiled and withdrew with the empty plate. Within 10 minutes the man was eating again. There were a great many black cars and luxury sedans out front blocking traffic that night. Across the dining room there was a long table of women in abayas, silently perusing menus. “Saudi princess,” said the maître d’hôtel. They sat on the banquette with their menus, waiting for a signal from her highness, who had the center seat. There at that table not covered in wines, they sat in two straight lines, Middle Eastern Madelines. It was a picture-book moment in Manhattan, Nello at its finest.”",0
Jean-Georges,"“Jean-Georges is still a four-star restaurant. That is all. Thank you for your time. On second thought, there may be a little more to say. Because great restaurants can fade fast, especially these days, and Jean-Georges Vongerichten’s serene flagship serves a city vastly different from the one it set out to dazzle and seduce 17 years ago last month. Back then, Jean-Georges was a radical reimagining of the grand style of French dining, “an entirely new kind of four-star restaurant,” as Ruth Reichl put it in her review for The New York Times. Jean-Georges didn’t just blow the dust off the candelabra; it tossed them out. In a room that was all right angles and Manhattan energy, men and women servers (a rarity in formal restaurants then) circulated with unfussy, level, American poise. Most of all there was the brilliant cooking, which was lighter, brighter and more embracing of other cultures than French food had any right to be. What we want from restaurants is changing, though, along with our notions of luxury. The kind of comfort Jean-Georges excels at providing makes some diners distinctly uncomfortable. Chefs who couldn’t peel a banana when Jean-Georges Vongerichten got his first four-star review (for Lafayette, in 1988) now run adventurous, unluxurious dining rooms where people come for the journey and where the thrill of the ride is more important than the condition of the shock absorbers. Jean-Georges glides like a Mercedes sedan, but Mr. Vongerichten takes the curves like a Formula One driver. Consider the squab dish that just popped up on the menu. It comes on like jerk chicken, coated in a blackened rub, and while the seasonings are Middle Eastern, the searing heat is almost Jamaican. And here comes the creative leap that separates Mr. Vongerichten from other spice-peddlers: a hot sauce has been splashed around this charred squab, and it is made from flowers. A bright-orange blend of lime, fresh red chiles and peppery nasturtium petals, it makes the already fiery squab into what may be the spiciest dish ever served in a French restaurant. Over and over, Mr. Vongerichten takes risks that are almost shocking. A little canal dredged into a pool of sweet parsnip purée is filled with a fruity riesling raisin vinegar, straight up. Taste it alone and you pucker, but swirl it into the parsnips with a forkful of meltingly soft Arctic char under an airy black-truffle crust, and it’s spectacular. In the same vein, the buttermilk sauce under red sea bream sashimi or the unsweetened lemon mousse with raw sea trout and roe are almost acidic enough on their own to clean copper pots. Taste a little of everything, though, and the sourness takes its place and galvanizes the rest. There’s not much sleight-of-hand in Mr. Vongerichten’s cooking. Nearly everything is visible, and the effects can still take you by surprise. Won tons stuffed with grilled foie gras are squirted, somewhat randomly, with a spiced red-wine reduction, but what makes the dish take off are the tart, crunchy passion-fruit seeds and the raw papaya chunks livened up with a dab of lime gel. This skill for getting the greatest impact from just a few components is Mr. Vongerichten’s foremost talent. Most of the time, you couldn’t take something away from one of his dishes without hurting the whole. This is why so many of his classics still jump with energy; they’re not dragged down by pointless ornamentation. Was the sweet sea urchin with slivers of green chile and drops of yuzu on a tongue of black bread invented last week, or last century? What about that intensely aromatic lobster sauce seasoned with fenugreek and lemon grass that surrounds lobster on toast? Or the chicken with the Parmesan crust that stays crunchy for an improbably long time, even after crumbs have fallen into the lemon-butter sauce that has more lemon and more balance than ought to be possible? If you are having your first $118 four-course dinner at Jean-Georges, you won’t always know. Regulars will, though. And they may start to wonder, along with me, how many of Mr. Vongerichten’s new dishes are as indelible as his greatest hits? I couldn’t imagine improving on any of the six savory dishes I enjoyed on a $198 tasting menu of classics. They had all snapped into place for good. The only dish on a spring tasting (same night, same length, same price) that I could pay the same compliment to were the stout asparagus stalks under morels in hollandaise, and I recall people rhapsodizing about them in 1997. This could become a danger to Jean-Georges’s pre-eminence. Mr. Vongerichten and his business partner, Phil Suarez, run a company that is responsible for 22 restaurants around the world. Diners tend to worry about this empire-building in terms of quality control: Does the food suffer when the head of state is traveling? It can, even at Jean-Georges. At a recent lunch while Mr. Vongerichten was in Japan, a salmon tartare spring roll, one of the three little bites that opened the meal, wasn’t crisp enough to stand up to its lettuce wrap, and the fish was barely seasoned. Gulf shrimp in an appetizer were overpowered by the heavily toasted flavors of fried artichokes and mushrooms, and a lemon-fennel aioli lacked the verve to pull it all together. These were blips, though, well within the standard deviation for one of New York’s most daring and high-performing kitchens. In the long run, the greater question is whether Mr. Vongerichten is channeling more of his creativity into building new restaurants than into building dishes that might run 10 years from now on the classics menu at Jean-Georges. Because each dessert is made of several mini-desserts that riff on a single theme, it’s hard to tell whether any of them has the staying power of the molten chocolate cake. (It has a permanent spot on the chocolate-themed dessert, and remains better than its imitators.) But as constructed by the pastry chef, Joseph Murphy, almost all of them are deeply, instantly lovable. For anyone feeling left behind by the current fashion for scattershot, disputatious desserts, Mr. Murphy’s citrus tasting — with its tiny, crisp strudel filled with candied kumquats and pistachios, and its plush, delicately floral citron snow and citrus sections over amber riesling jelly — is an answered prayer. The wine list is book-length. But it is unusually nimble, built for versatility. The chief sommelier, Laura Williamson, has a bottle up her sleeve for any trick the kitchen might pull. Listening to her or one of her colleagues suggest a wine can be a quick, thoughtful education in the principles of pairing. The rest of the dining room staff has the original poise and unfawning attentiveness, but servers can seem remote. Smiles bloom beside some tables, but not all. Lately some top-tier restaurants have invented a new style of service that is seamless, intuitive, guided by a species of emotional intelligence. Jean-Georges hasn’t quite evolved. Examples are so minor that they may sound petty, but here’s one. A guest of mine approached the reception desk, a sci-fi podium populated by a row of three or four humans with unnervingly perfect teeth, at the same time as two other diners. A host tried to pair them off: “Are you two together?” Um, no. Another attempt was made: “Are you two together?” Unless Mr. Vongerichten is trying to run a matchmaking service, there are smoother ways to begin. The game can always be played at a higher level. That is the challenge for any restaurant that wants to shine among the striving competition. And Jean-Georges does shine. The restaurant was redesigned in graceful, gentle curves by the architect Thomas Juul-Hansen in 2008 (two years after Frank Bruni’s four-star review, its last evaluation in The Times) and is the most elegant modern dining room in the city. The enormous windows let in the setting sun, and sometimes they catch the moon rising over the treetops in Central Park. You are in the city and hovering slightly outside it all at once. Then the food arrives, the flavors fall into their startling alignments, and there is only one place you could be: Jean-Georges.”",2
Eulalie,"“In 2014, when I had my first meal at the Simone, you could have described it as slightly behind the times. The pace was languid. The menus were handwritten. The chef, Chip Smith, molded regional American flavors over a frame of French technique. The dining room, on the ground floor of an Upper East Side townhouse, was about as loud as an Alpine forest during a light snowfall. Online, the Simone made almost no noise at all. You really had to search for its website, and it wasn’t listed on any of the reservation sites. If you wanted to book a table, you had to pick up the phone and call Tina Vaughn, who ran the restaurant with Chip, her partner in life and business. She would write your name in a hardcover appointment book. The couple continued running the Simone this way until 2022, when the restaurant, in financial straits, was closed by the owner, Robert Margolis. And this is how they operate Eulalie, which they opened in TriBeCa in October. A decade ago, refusing to take online reservations put them in a distinct minority. Today it makes them seem like members of an isolated religious sect. It’s hard to remember now, but not long ago, smart restaurants saw the reservation phone call as a chance to make you feel welcome even if your meal was still a month away. The conversation was the start of something — if you were lucky, something nice. Today it’s almost never that. Reservations are commodities. They’re bought, traded, set aside for American Express card holders, and scalped by whoever can build the fastest bot. At best, securing a prime table can make you feel like you’ve won some low-stakes game in the world’s most boring casino. Eulalie is not part of this casino. It seems blithely clueless about TikTok trends, plating trends, wine trends and just about any other trend you can think of. It will probably strike some people as hopelessly dated. But I suspect that for many more, it will be a welcome break from the impersonal, transactional feeling so many New York restaurants leave you with these days. Some sense of déjà vu will be inevitable for certain diners walking into Eulalie. (Oo-LAH-lee is how Ms. Vaughn says it.) Mr. Smith and Ms. Vaughn took over the lease on the West Broadway address from Drew Nieporent, who ran Bâtard there, and Corton before that, and Montrachet before that, which takes us back to 1985. If you went to any of those places, you know the layout. There is the compact little bar by the entrance, where Ms. Vaughn’s reservation book will be lying open. The simple box of a dining room is just beyond. There are white linens everywhere, fewer than 40 seats, two antique chests of drawers bequeathed by the radio host Phil Schaap, and enough space between the tables for a square dance. The room has the soothing, muted look of a color card from Farrow & Ball. Servers at Eulalie don’t tell you that they need the table back in 90 minutes. In fact, they seem determined to make you forget about the passing of time. Once you are settled, Ms. Vaughn makes her way to your table to offer you “a splash.” Typically this means half a glass or so of her favorite rosé at the moment, though it could be Champagne in a vintage coupe with a hollow stem. Servers glide into sight bearing a slab of a rustic terrine — pork, chicken livers, and fat veins of foie gras the last time I saw it — made by Mr. Smith. It is very good. Only at this point, when you’ve had something to eat and to drink, does the menu appear, written in a willowy cursive. For younger diners who never had to suffer through penmanship classes, the menu might as well be written in Cyrillic, but it describes a very simple proposition: the terrine you’ve just eaten, followed by an appetizer; then a poached flounder mousse with caviar in a few spoonfuls of creamy, anise-scented fish soup; and a main course. The price for this is $115 — more if you want cheese or dessert or wines paired with each course. At the bottom are two notes: “Welcome to our new home … and yours!” And: “Please, cellphones tucked away!!” Curse you, modern technology! Note, however, that nobody said a word as I used my phone to photograph every dish and to Shazam a jazz tune playing so low that I wouldn’t have been able to hear at all if I hadn’t been sitting next to the speaker. Mr. Smith comes from North Carolina, and good things happen in the kitchen when he goes back to his roots. He cooks an appetizer that merges the trotter croquettes known in France as cromesquis with Carolina barbecue. Surrounding a tower of pulled pork are Japanese turnips and their greens in a vinegar-spiked potlikker. Ms. Vaughn says she reserves standing tables for customers who come in at the same time every week and have done so for years. You’ll understand why when you taste these trotters. There may be something a little Southern-fried, too, about Eulalie’s sweetbreads. Served with herbed carrots in an onion sauce, they have a more substantial crunch than they might in Lyon. Substantial is the word when it comes to the main courses, too. Roasted venison saddle, farmed in Dutchess County, N.Y., is cut into slices that are nearly an inch thick, much leaner and slightly gamier than prime rib. For a special one night Mr. Smith was poaching the meat of a whole lobster in butter, including two claws the size of a child’s mittens. This was surrounded by hen-of-the-woods mushrooms, chestnuts and butternut squash in several forms. It’s been a long time since I’ve seen butter-poached lobster, and even longer since I’ve had one as supernaturally sweet and tender as Eulalie’s. Mr. Smith makes all the desserts himself, starting early in the morning. He’s always the first to arrive at the restaurant, his wife told us. Other things we learned from her: She used to be a Rockette, and she loves the documentary “Scatter My Ashes at Bergdorf’s.” She is not introverted, and if she senses that you are interested in chatting, she could — by which I mean that she almost definitely will — become a character in your night at Eulalie. In a lot of restaurants these days, it’s hard to tell who’s in charge. Often the answer is nobody, and you walk out convinced that nobody noticed or cared that you’d been there. Ms. Vaughn cares. She owns the place and acts like it. So, in his way, does Mr. Smith, who slips into the dining room after the last table has been served. First, though, he plates his desserts. When a Southern cook makes a coconut cake, you should probably try it, and Mr. Smith’s is a beauty, a white drum rolled in fresh meringue and shingled with curls of fresh coconut. But keep your options open, because he sometimes makes a thing called a boca negra. It is like a cross between a bourbon ball and a molten chocolate cake. Molten chocolate cake, of course, went out of style a long time ago. But as far as I can tell, it didn’t stop being delicious.”",2
Sailor,"“Trying to recover from a catastrophe that nearly ended her career, April Bloomfield is cooking the best food she’s ever made at her new restaurant in Brooklyn, Sailor. She has always been able to express herself in the kitchen more easily than in interviews. When asked by a New York Times reporter in 2018 how she had allowed her former business partner, Ken Friedman, to get away with behavior that several former employees said included groping them and pressuring them for sex, she seemed at a loss for words. In the end, every restaurant she and Mr. Friedman owned was sold or closed. There’s no way to wrap up that chapter of Ms. Bloomfield’s career with a neat moral conclusion, or even a messy one. Like many chefs, she was a good cook and a bad manager, very much in her element in the kitchen and less so when faced with the other responsibilities of owning restaurants. Sailor, which was opened in September, is owned by the restaurateur Gabriel Stulman with his wife, Gina. It is the most mature restaurant of his career, and Ms. Bloomfield’s, too. Starting with the Spotted Pig, probably the first gastro pub in the United States, Ms. Bloomfield’s places blurred and sometimes erased the line between bar and restaurant. Considering that alcohol was almost always implicated in the worst goings-on at the Pig, the lines may have become too blurred. But this collapsing of distinctions was widely influential. Soon people in Ohio, Texas and other places found themselves wondering if they were in a bar with exceptional food or a restaurant where lots of people stood around with drinks in their hands. One restaurateur who had to have been paying attention was Mr. Stulman, although the vibe at Joseph Leonard and his other places in Greenwich Village was more “New Yorkers hooking up” than “backstage with the Rolling Stones.” Sailor, in any case, has two distinct sides: an 18-seat barroom, where reservations are not taken, and a 20-seat dining room where they are, and disappear within minutes of being offered. Which side you will eat on is a question of whether you would rather hang around on DeKalb Avenue waiting for the door to open on the day you want to eat, or loiter on Resy at 11 a.m. two weeks before. Neither half is rollicking. People go there to eat. Lamps with brass pedestals, bright enough to help diners with fading eyesight read the menu, sit on every table. A movable ladder, as in an old library, climbs to the higher shelves where wine is kept, or at least displayed. The linens are white, the trim navy, the art nautical. Ms. Bloomfield’s understanding of her craft has deepened since the crack-up. She is now one of the most expressive cooks in the city. She doesn’t get her ideas across through bizarre marriages of ingredients or avant-garde technique. She does it by burrowing down into an ingredient until she’s found flavors nobody else seems to know how to reach. I’ve always thought celery root was a two-speed vegetable: It goes straight from raw and crisp to cooked and mushy. Poaching it in small dice that hold their shape, Ms. Bloomfield locates a third speed: firm, yielding and soft enough around the edges to drink in their dressing of melted butter and lemon juice. There is also a roasted fennel bulb, sticky with caramelized pan juices, laid over creamed goat cheese and herbs — a nod and a wink to Boursin. Cooking like this is often called intuitive, which is silly. As with any other skill, you get better at cooking by being responsive and observant and by remembering what you’ve learned. You really need to get to know your radishes if you want them to end up as wonderful as the ones at Sailor, which are tart and still a little crisp after cooking in lambic. They are also draped with guanciale. A generation ago, when American chefs seemed to be trying to out-swine one another, almost nobody dished up the pork fat more generously than Ms. Bloomfield. (She called her first book “A Girl and Her Pig.”) But these bands of guanciale are shaved so thin you could read the menu through them. This is not the lard-slinging April Bloomfield of old, and the guanciale is playing the role that olive oil plays in Sailor’s terrific radicchio salad — it blunts the vinegar. There is a new restraint in her cooking, and possibly a sense of mortality. Ms. Bloomfield makes very little obvious effort to dress the food up. It just looks good, the way that delicious things tend to. Some of her dishes are not too far removed from farmhouse cooking, although it’s hard to tell if the farm is in England (where Ms. Bloomfield lived until she was hired for the Spotted Pig), or France, or Connecticut. There’s one called Toast With Green Sauce + Parmesan that is basically a thick slice of toasted polenta Pullman drowned in chopped herbs with capers, anchovies and oil. Cheese has been grated over the top, making it something like a Welsh rarebit with an Italian salsa verde. It might have been dreamed up by a hungry cook standing in the light of an open refrigerator at midnight. The main courses are not all-out assaults on the human body, as they sometimes seemed to be in the old days. There is a piece of cod, medium-size, patiently bronzed and given to you “in a soup with coriander relish.” The soup tastes something like bouillabaisse. It is very good. One night there might be a juicy, pinkish pork chop with tender whole shallots in a syrupy brown reduction. On another, you could find a pork shoulder steak, brined and smoked but not hammy, and braised with meaty green olives until it is barely able to hold itself together. Whenever you go there will be a half chicken roasted with herb butter under its skin. It is crowded into a cast-iron casserole with a tawny pool of gravy, almost as sticky as jelly, and flaky roasted potatoes that have been joined together with big chips of fried Parmesan. I ate this the night after Thanksgiving and became convinced that if everybody gave up turkey and just had Sailor’s roast chicken once a year, the country would be a better place. Ms. Bloomfield’s desserts are known for their ability to bring on childhood memories of an intensely British nature in people who’ve never been near Britain. The ginger cake with a huge blot of whipped cream at Sailor is the latest example. But the profiteroles are sort of magical. The puff pastry crackles as you chew, and the sauce is not the usual chocolate but a rich, dark caramel. I have friends who won’t watch Woody Allen’s movies. I’m sure some people will feel the same way about eating in Ms. Bloomfield’s restaurant. I went the first time because it’s my job, but I went back and chose to write about it because something in the cooking spoke to me. Celery root and radishes and potatoes don’t usually move me. They did at Sailor.”",2
Foxface Natural,"“Since it opened on a high-traffic strip of Avenue A in the spring, Foxface Natural has kept a low profile, as discreet and self-contained as a sealed envelope. At times it almost seems to be hiding. Slats on the window make it hard to see inside from the street. The exterior is painted battleship gray. There is no sign. Nevertheless, the restaurant has attracted a small and fervent following. I don’t know many people who’ve eaten there so far, at least compared with Libertine or the new I Sodi, but the ones I do know say it’s their favorite new restaurant. It has become one of mine, too. Whether it will be yours may depend on your tolerance for eccentricity. The soundtrack is heavy on recent Australian punk bands like Amyl and the Sniffers, the Chats and Alien Nosejob, played loud. The menu demands an adventurous spirit. If you get the whole fluke, roasted in a wood oven and served in a lake of olive oil with fistfuls of chopped garlic and parsley, the fish will not be filleted for you on a tableside gueridon. You will pick the flesh from the bones yourself. For the right diners, this will be an exciting chance to learn about flatfish anatomy. For the wrong ones, it will be a nightmare. As a dinner companion in the first category put it while he was contemplating how best to eat the dorsal fin, which had browned in the oil into a long, crunchy and, as it turned out, delicious ridge, “This is not a restaurant for Karens.” Foxface Natural describes itself in its Instagram bio as “a natural continuation of Foxface sandwiches.” This is like calling day a natural continuation of night. It’s accurate, but it leaves a lot unsaid. The last time I’d seen the name Foxface, it was on a sign outside what had once been the ticket office of Theatre 80 St Marks. Behind a window, sandwiches filled with things like elk osso buco or stewed tripe with ’nduja were being sold by a couple who live next door to the theater, Sivan Lahat and Ori Kushnir. They had no room for seats, but if you wanted to eat your sandwich right away they’d invite you to take it inside a tavern next door that specialized in very old film soundtracks and absinthe. This kept up for about three years before Foxface closed last September. I haven’t seen any elk or tripe yet at Foxface Natural. But that doesn’t mean that Ms. Lahat and Mr. Kushnir have settled into a routine of chicken tenders. Roasted antelope chops appeared one night recently, and you can usually find a very good hand-chopped tartare of kangaroo. Raw kangaroo has a deeper and sometimes gamier flavor than beef, and David Santos, the executive chef, takes advantage of that by incorporating a complex spice blend inspired by Ethiopia into the purplish meat and serving it with a smoky, black purée of charred eggplant. The meat that made the deepest impression on me was smoked Boer goat. A breed developed in South Africa, Boers are raised for eating, as opposed to milking or making into angora sweaters. Mr. Santos cooks it overnight at a low temperature in a smoker inherited from the last tenant, Harry & Ida’s Meat and Supply Co. The pastrami that Harry & Ida’s made in it became an obsession for lovers of smoked meat. Foxface’s goat is a worthy successor to the pastrami — maybe even a natural continuation. What it most reminds me of, though, is Texas Hill Country barbecue, if pitmasters in Texas served their barbecue with things like saffron-scented tomato sauce and creamy roasted new-crop potatoes. The mammals are likely to be the first thing most people notice about the menu. After four meals at Foxface Natural, though, I’ve come to think of it as a seafood restaurant that occasionally dabbles in antelope. Although most of the fish Mr. Santos serves are the opposite of exotic — he favors black sea bass, striped bass and a few other fixtures of the local waters— he is particular about whom he buys them from. He prefers fish that are caught on the end of a line by crews that practice the Japanese slaughtering technique known as ikejime. This method, thought to be more humane, also keeps the fish firm. You may notice the texture in uncooked dishes like the Boston mackerel that he cured in salt and apple vinegar one night. This was a take on a sushi-bar standard, served with a very un-Japanese sweet-pepper relish spooned over a fermented-pepper purée on a plate dotted with beehive-shaped domes of ricotta. (Like the heap of salted butter that accompanies each order of sourdough bread, the ricotta is made at the restaurant.) I am sure, too, that ikejime was one thing that made it so pleasurable to dismantle and compare the flavors and textures of different parts of the roasted fluke, or to pull the flesh from the head, throat and belly of a butterflied black sea bass. But the thing that will really win over people who appreciate fresh fish is that Mr. Santos never seems to overcook it. He’ll pull it from the fire while there’s still some pink at the bone and sticky jellies still cling to the cartilage. Dave Pasternack used to cook fish that way when Esca was still open. Eric Ripert and a handful of other chefs still do, but many others won’t. No doubt they get tired of having customers send fish back if it’s not completely firm and almost dry. So far, Mr. Santos doesn’t seem worried about that. Of course, diners who won’t eat slightly pink sea bass may be reluctant to sign on for certain other items at Foxface Natural, too. Boiled gooseneck barnacles, for instance, which have been compared to dinosaur toes. Or the squares of grilled pig ear topped with white strips that look suspiciously like offal. These turn out to be the pickled skirt trimmed from a scallop — shellfish offal. They are very good dragged through a salsa verde tasting of parsley and cilantro, or a second sauce, a garlic-infused emulsion based on Basque pil-pil. Mr. Santos, who was the chef and owner of a Portuguese restaurant in the Village called Louro until it closed eight years ago, brings a wide frame of reference to his kitchen. Some of his cooking, like the pil-pil and the fluke in olive oil, is flat-out Iberian. For striped bass steaks roasted on the spine he chose a spiced tomato sauce, chraime, originally from North Africa. The black sea bass, painted with turmeric sauce and splashed with what was essentially dill pistou, seemed to be an inspired reworking of the signature dish of Hanoi’s most famous fish restaurant, Cha Ca La Vong. Most of the main courses at Foxface Natural will feed two. When an especially large fish has come in, it may be enough for three or four. “We’re not small-plates people,” Ms. Lahat said across the counter one night. They are, however, natural-wine people. The wines themselves are quite approachable, although the list is sometimes less than self-explanatory. The entire entry for one white poured by the glass reads “GraWü, Chourmo.” Does GraWü go down well with raw kangaroo? There is, it’s safe to say, only one place in New York to find out.”",2
Naro,"“At their groundbreaking restaurant Atomix, Junghyun and Jeongeun Park seem to have the keys to a secret room filled with flavors that New York’s older Korean restaurants barely hint at. Nearly every course on the elaborate tasting menus is made up of a dozen or more ingredients. There are stunning imported vinegars derived from mugwort, birch and cherry blossoms. Kimchi, often made on site, does not stop with cabbage and radishes but plunges into a realm of fermented tomatoes, chiles and mustard leaves. Some interesting items turn up on the plates at Naro, too, which the Parks — he goes by J.P. and she is called Ellia — have been operating in the Rockefeller Center concourse since October. You can, for instance, eat a sorbet flavored by the fleshy seed stalks of the Japanese raisin tree. But novelty is not the main point of this younger restaurant. While Atomix tries to expand our notions of what modern Korean cuisine might contain, Naro’s executive chef, Nate Kuester, takes a different tack. His kitchen dives straight into traditional foods, starting with favorites like bibimbap and seafood jeon and reaching back to recipes that predate the 20th century, in ways that make them seem full of unexplored potential. Naengchae, a chilled salad usually presented with thin strips of vegetables fanned out on a plate, is a mainstay of Korean tables inside and outside the home. At Naro, the naengchae looks like a nest of vermicelli noodles when it shows up. The vermicelli turn out to be threads of kohlrabi, and they sit on top of lumps of king crab, slices of simmered octopus, wheels of watermelon radish and dabs of hot mustard, all meant to be stirred together. There’s something else, too: flaky crystals of radish granita. This is an allusion to mul naengmyeon, cold noodles served in ice-cold, sometimes slushy brine that is used to pickle radishes. It’s a magician’s trick, this salad that turns into noodles that turn back into a salad again. Another illusion: the one-bite appetizer that looks at first like a piece of kimbap, soft tendrils of bracken fern wrapped in a belt of seaweed. When you eat it, though, you discover that the seaweed has somehow become as puffy and crunchy as a cracker — a version of gim bugak, the fried seaweed snack. Sanjeok, normally a straightforward skewer of grilled meats and vegetables, is also reimagined at Naro. Sweet soft bricks of butternut squash alternate with lengths of emulsified chicken sausage. It is surely the best chicken hot dog on a stick ever served in a Korean restaurant. Simpler dishes hold discoveries at Naro, too, like mixed mushrooms stir-fried with pickled burdock and mounded over a bowl of short-grain rice. The mushrooms are seasoned with sesame oil and seeds, and the rice is merely steamed, but very few things I’ve eaten lately have tasted as rare and luxurious. And this is only a side dish. It showed up, with no warning from the menu, alongside a snowy block of halibut in a golden, aromatic broth made from the rice wine cheongju. You eat all this and more in a spare, incongruously futuristic dining room separated from the concourse by a curving Art Deco glass wall. Black chairs punctuate an expanse of white and off-white panels and banquettes, making the space look something like a set from “2001: A Space Odyssey.” (It may be relevant that Naro-1 was the name of the first South Korean rocket to place a satellite in orbit around the earth.) A darker shade of paint on the ceiling and the sheer curtains that appeared on the glass wall in April have made the space look slightly less sci-fi. It is not the only change at Naro as the Parks try to adapt their vision of formal Korean dining to an underground mall full of office workers, tourists, commuters and skaters. The price of the tasting menus at dinner (one vegetarian and one not, each with about 11 courses) dropped to $165 from $195. Lunch, which had been a five-course, $95 tasting, now comes in a variety of sizes: two courses for $52, two courses and dessert for $68, and an à la carte menu that runs from $19 to $46. The Parks have always been skilled at fitting their hospitality style to their interiors. At their first restaurant, Atoboy, which looks like an after-work canteen that might have been designed by Marcel Breuer, the hospitality strikes a gracious, casual tone. The precise but engaging spirit at Atomix sets the standard for tasting-counter service in the city. Naro aims for a blend of formality and friendliness, and servers are quick with a smile. They’re quick all around, and not always in the right way. Early on, explanations of some dishes were so rushed I am still not quite sure what I ate, and the check was dropped at the same time as dessert; before I’d picked up a spoon, somebody circled back for my credit card. The pace has slowed, but I still get the sense that Naro, like some of the other new restaurants in the concourse, is still trying to catch the rhythms of Rockefeller Center, where some people come just to look around and others are on their way to some other place. None of this seems to afflict Naro’s kitchen, which has always been uncannily assured. The pastry chef, Celia Lee, who was last seen at the Modern, puts together sweet meditations that could probably stand alone if the Parks decided to turn Naro into a dessert bar. Her sorbet of hallabong tangerines, a prized product of the island of Jeju, paired with fresh tangerine sections and a fluffy gin-scented cloud of Negroni over jellied Champagne, might even work at one of the city’s more forward-thinking cocktail bars.”",2
